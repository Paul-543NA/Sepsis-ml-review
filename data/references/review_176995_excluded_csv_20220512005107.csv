MuLan: Multilevel Language-based Representation Learning for Disease Progression Modeling,"Sohn, H.; Park, K.; Chi, M.; Wu, X.; Jermaine, C.; Xiong, L.; Hu, X. T.; Kotevska, O.; Lu, S.; Xu, W.; Aluru, S.; Zhai, C.; Al-Masri, E.; Chen, Z.; Saltz, J.; Ankura, T. M.; Ibm,; Ieee,; Ieee Computer Society","Modeling patient disease progression using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is crucial to assist clinical decision making. In recent years, deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have shown great success in handling sequential multivariate data, such as EHRs. Despite their great success, it is often difficult to interpret and visualize patient disease progression learned from these models in a meaningful yet unified way. In this work, we present MuLan: a Multilevel Language-based representation learning framework that can automatically learn a hierarchical representation for EHRs at entry, event, and visit levels. We validate MuLan on modeling the progression of an extremely challenging disease, septic shock, by using real-world EHRs. Our results showed that these unified multilevel representations can be utilized not only for interpreting and visualizing the latent mechanism of patients' septic shock progressions but also for early detection of septic shock.

Improving sepsis resuscitation with reinforcement learning,"Komorowski, M.","Sepsis is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the main cause of mortality in hospitals1, but the best treatment strategy remains uncertain. In particular, evidence suggests that current practices in the administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors are suboptimal and likely induce harm in a proportion of patients1,2. To tackle this sequential decision-making problem, I used reinforcement learning, a class of machine learning algorithms whose goal is to estimate an optimal set of rules that maximises some form of reward.3 Similarly, a clinician's goal is to make therapeutic decisions in order to maximize a patient's probability of a good outcome. An artificial intelligence (AI) agent was built and validated on two large non-overlapping ICU databases, containing data routinely collected from adult patients in the U.S.A. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care version III (MIMIC-III) was used for model development and the eICU Research Institute Database (eRI) for model testing. All patients included fulfilled the sepsis-3 criteria. The final datasets contain 17,083 admissions from MIMIC-III from 5 separate ICUs in one hospital and 79,073 admissions from 128 different hospitals from eRI. I extracted up to 72 hours of data per patient, in the form of time series of 48 variables, including demographics, Elixhauser premorbid status, vital signs, laboratory values, fluids and vasopressors received. A Markov decision process (MDP) was used to model the patient environment and trajectories. 3 The various elements of the model were defined using patient data time series from the training set (Figure 1). I deployed the AI agent to solve the MDP and predict outcomes of treatment strategies. First, I evaluated the actual treatments of clinicians, by analysing all the prescriptions and computing the average return of each treatment option, which can take values from-100 to +100 in my model. Then, the MDP was solved using an algorithm called policy iteration, which identified the treatments that maximised return, that is, the expected 90-day survival of patients. 3 This process generated a new treatment strategy (termed ""a policy"" in reinforcement learning) for sepsis optimizing 90-day mortality, which could be applied in real-time at the patient level. Figure 1: Data flow of the AI agent. Eighty percent of the MIMIC-III dataset was used to define the elements of the Markov decision process. Time series of patient data were clustered into finite states. The dose of intravenous fluids and vasopressors were discretized into 25 possible actions. Patients' survival at 90 days after ICU admission defined rewards. Reinforcement learning was used to estimate optimal treatment strategies. The remaining 20% MIMIC-III data was used to identify the best model among 500 candidates, which was then tested on an independent dataset from the eRI database. It was crucial to obtain reliable estimates of the performance of this new policy without deploying it, since executing a bad policy would be dangerous for patients3,4. In reinforcement learning, evaluating the performance of a new policy using trajectories generated by another policy (the clinicians' policy) is termed off-policy evaluation3,4. I implemented a type of off-policy evaluation called weighted importance sampling, and used bootstrapping to estimate the true distribution of the value of the AI policy.4 500 candidate models were built, and I selected the one maximising the theoretical statistical safety of the new AI policy. Then, the chosen AI policy was tested on the independent eRI dataset. Figure 2a shows the distribution of the estimated value of the clinicians' policy and the AI policy in the selected final model tested on the eRI cohort. The median value of the AI policy, at 84.5 (interquartile range 84.3-87.7), was reliably higher than that of clinicians' (median 56.9, interquartile range 54.7-58.8). Figures 2b and 2c show the distribution of treatment doses according to clinicians' and AI policies. On average, the AI agent recommended lower doses of intravenous fluids and higher doses of vasopressors, compared to clinicians' actual treatments. While the proportion of time the eRI patients received vasopressors was only 17%, that would have been 30% if following the AI agent. I analysed patient mortality when the dose actually administered corresponded to or differed from the dose suggested by the AI agent. The patients who received doses similar to the doses recommended by the AI agent had the lowest mortality. Giving more or less than the AI policy of either treatment was associated with increasing mortality rates, in a dose-dependent fashion (Figures 2d and 2e). When the actual dose given was different from the suggested dose, clinicians gave more or less fluids in similar proportions, and less vasopressors 75% of the time. The median dose deficit in patients who received too little vasopressors was 0.13 mug/kg/min (interquartile range 0.04-0.27 mug/kg/min). Figure 2.

All actions were aggregated over all time steps for the 5 dose bins of both medications. On average, patients were administered more intravenous fluid (b) and less vasopressor (c) medications than recommended by the AI policy. Vasopressor dose is in mug/kg/min of norepinephrine equivalent and intravenous fluids dose is in mL/4 hours. d and e, The dose excess refers to the difference between the given and suggested dose averaged over all time points per patient. The shaded area represents the standard error of the mean. In both plots, the smallest dose difference was associated with the best survival rates (vertical dotted line). The further away the dose received was from the suggested dose, the worse the outcome. In this research, I demonstrated how reinforcement learning could be applied to solve a complex medical problem, and suggest individualized treatment strategies for sepsis. When clinicians' actual treatments varied from the AI agent's suggested policy, this was most commonly to administer too little vasopressor. Early use of lowdose vasopressor has been suggested in sepsis2,5. This may avoid administering excessive amounts of fluids, which has been linked with poorer outcome2,5. My results support this strategy but importantly allow the treatment to be individualized for each patient. My vision is that this system will be used in real-time, using data streams in electronic health records to suggest a course of action. Physicians will always need to make subjective clinical judgments about treatment strategies, but computational models can provide additional insight about optimal decisions, avoiding targeting short-term resuscitation goals and instead following trajectories towards longer-term survival. There are limitations to this study. Although the datasets are large and used routinely collected clinical data, some sites and patients had to be excluded due to poor quality data recording or missing data. Due to differences between the two datasets, slightly different implementations of the sepsis-3 criteria were used, and hospital mortality was used in eRI instead of 90-day mortality. Finally, some laboratory values would not have been immediately available to clinicians to inform decision making but were available to the AI agent. This work will clearly require prospective evaluation using real-time data and in clinical trials, but if only a few percent reduction in mortality from sepsis could be achieved, this would represent several tens of thousands of lives saved annually, worldwide. In the last 10 to 15 years, attempts to develop novel treatments to reduce sepsis mortality have uniformly been unsuccessful2,5. The use of computer decision support systems to better guide treatments and improve outcomes is therefore a much-needed approach.

Assessing the Predictive Value of Clinical Factors Used to Determine the Presence of Sepsis Causing Shock in the Emergency Department,"Carey, Jeremy R.; Oedorf, Kimie; Day, Danielle E.; Redfield, Colby S.; Huguenel, Colin J.; Roberts, Jonathan C.; Sanchez, Leon D.; Wolfe, Richard E.; Henning, Daniel J.; Shapiro, Nathan I.; Novack, Victor","Introduction: Differentiating shock etiologies is a challenging task in the Emergency Department (ED); even the strongest clinical predictors leave some diagnostic uncertainty. This study sought to establish an evidence base for using clinical covariates in the diagnostic evaluation of septic shock. Method(s): We conducted a prospective, observational study of consecutive ED patients with shock from November 11, 2012 to September 23, 2013. We included all patients at least 18 years old with shock, defined as new vasopressor requirement, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg after at least 1 L of crystalloid or 2 units packed red blood cells, or systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg and fluids withheld due to concern for fluid overload. Multivariate logistic regression and recursive partitioning models were constructed, predicting septic cause of shock. The logistic regression model was derived using first 500 patients, and validated with the subsequent 200 patients. Result(s): In the derivation cohort, 55.6% (95% confidence interval: 51.2%-60.0%) were septic, and 20.8% (17.2%-24.4%) died during hospitalization. The multivariate model (derivation area under the curve = 0.88, validation area under the curve = 0.89) identified predictors of septic shock, including temperature more than 100.4degreeF (odds ratio 4.6, 2.3-9.2) and history of fever (odds ratio 9.2, 4.4-19.2); however, only 153 of 277 (55.3%, 49.5%-61.2%) patients with septic shock had either of these findings. In the recursive partitioning model, if all predictors were absent, the probability of sepsis causing shock was 21% (16.6%-25.6%). Conclusion(s): Clinical data can predict the presence of sepsis causing shock in the ED in most patients. The remaining diagnostic uncertainty provides an opportunity for adding novel diagnostic testing.Copyright Â© 2016 by the Shock Society.",2016,,Shock,46,1,27-32,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SHK.0000000000000558,,#2216,Carey 2016,"Exclusion reason: Predicts incorrect outcome; Finneas Catling (2022-03-05 04:40:29)(Select): I've just moved this back to full-text review.

Automated pressure regulation system for sepsis (auto-press): Reinforcement learning agent learns to provide vasopressor and intravenous fluid recommendations to manage hypotensive episodes in septic patients,"Jeter, Russell; Nemati, Shamim; Josef, Christopher; Lehman, Li-Wei","Background: Sepsis is a syndromic, life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign has promulgated a set of recommended first hour actions; however, the preferred proportion of intravenous (IV) fluids and vasopressors used to treat hypotension can vary according to patient comorbidities, a clinician's area of expertise, and institutional policies. This variability in treatment patterns and the high number of changes that can occur throughout a treatment course has made it nearly impossible to retrospectively appreciate the ideal balance of vasoactive drugs and IV fluids. Method(s): A cohort of 5,366 hypotensive patients with sepsis that received vasopressor therapy was obtained from the MIMIC III dataset. Patient vitals, comorbidities, and IV fluid/vasopressor doses were then binned into one-hour intervals. Using these patient states and clinical actions, an artificial intelligence (AI) treatment recommendation system is trained using the REINFORCE algorithm, a machine learning algorithm that learns by observing clinical practices to generate a treatment policy. The recommendation system, AUTO-PRESS, is rewarded/penalized by a combination of factors that include improvements in MAP, SOFA score components, and mortality. A propensity score based causal treatment effects analysis is done to evaluate the utility of the AI recommendations on the retrospective data. Result(s): AUTO-PRESS learns to make recommendations that are similar to actual clinician recommendations. On average, AUTOPRESS tends to recommend fluid resuscitation faster than the real clinicians in the cohort and recommends on average that vasopressors be administered in small doses and at a later point in a patient's clinical course. A causal treatment effects analysis shows that if AUTO-PRESS's recommendation was followed for the retrospective cohort, survival rates could improve by as much as 10 - 15 %. Conclusion(s): Retrospective data from hypotensive sepsis patients can be used to create a machine learning algorithm that learns to analyze the patient state and make vasopressor and IV fluid recommendations to clinicians. After accounting for severity of illness and potential effects of treatment, recommendations from the AI system present a 10 - 15% increase in survival rates among the patient cohort. As a clinician-inthe- loop system, this presents a step forward in the standardization and individualization of blood pressure management in septic patients.",2019,,Shock,51,6 Supplement 1,45,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SHK.0000000000001374,,#3105,Jeter 2019,Exclusion reason: Poster / oral presentation; Finneas Catling (2022-03-27 21:52:01)(Select): Agree - I have moved back to FT screening and voted to exclude; Zuzanna Bien (2021-12-02 03:20:20)(Select): no access to supplement but looks like it's just an abstract; ,""
Knowledge-based approach to septic shock patient data using a neural network with trapezoidal activation functions,"Paetz, JÃ¼rgen","In this contribution we present an application of a knowledge-based neural network technique in the domain of medical research. We consider the crucial problem of intensive care patients developing a septic shock during their stay at the intensive care unit. Septic shock is of prime importance in intensive care medicine due to its high mortality rate. Our analysis of the patient data is embedded in a medical data analysis cycle, including preprocessing, classification, rule generation and interpretation. For classification and rule generation we chose an improved architecture based on a growing trapezoidal basis function network for our metric variables. Our results extend those of a black box classification and give a deeper insight in our patient data. We evaluate our results with classification and rule performance measures. For feature selection we introduce a new importance measure.",2003,,Artif. Intell.

Characteristics of Heart Rate Variability Can Predict Impending Septic Shock in Emergency Department Patients with Sepsis,"Chen, Wei-Lung; Kuo, Cheng-Deng","Objectives: To determine whether heart rate variability (HRV) measures can be used to predict which septic patients in the emergency department (ED) will progress to septic shock. Method(s): The authors prospectively enrolled consecutive patients who met the 2001 International Sepsis Definitions Conference criteria of sepsis and visited the ED of a university teaching hospital over a six-month period. In addition to the septic workup, a continuous 10-minute electrocardiogram recording was performed at the same time. The HRV measures were calculated off-line and correlated with the outcome of the patients. Result(s): Eighty-one patients aged 30-84 years who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. The patients were classified as those with no septic shock (n = 60) and those with septic shock (n = 21), according to their outcome within six hours. The baseline root mean square successive difference, high-frequency power, and normalized high-frequency power of the septic shock group were significantly higher than those of the no septic shock group. The low-frequency power, normalized low-frequency power, and low-/high-frequency power ratio of the septic shock group were significantly lower than those of the no septic shock group. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified root mean square successive difference as the best predictor of impending septic shock for septic ED patients. Conclusion(s): HRV measures may be used to identify septic ED patients with impending septic shock. Among those HRV measures, root mean square successive difference seems to be the best indicator to predict the occurrence of septic shock.

A Deep Learning-Based Sepsis Estimation Scheme,"Al-Mualemi, B. Y.; Lu, L.","The objective of this research is to design and implement a machine learning (ML) based technique that can predict cases of septic shock and extreme sepsis and assess its effects on medical practice and the patients. The study is a retrospective cohort type, which is used to algorithmic deduction and validation, along with pre- and post-impact assessment. For non-ICU cases, the algorithm was deduced and validated for specific periods. The classifiers used for the study have been deduced and validated by employing electronic health records (EHR), which were silent initially but alerted the clinical personnel concerning the sepsis prediction. For training the classification system, the chosen patients should have had ICD and the latest codes concerning extreme sepsis or septic shock. Moreover, the patients should have had positive blood culture during their interaction with the hospital, where there were indications of either systolic blood pressure (SBP) or lactate levels. The classification algorithms demonstrated a 93.84%, 93.22%, 95.25% accuracy, sensitivity and specificity respectively. The pattern used for clinical detection, in the context of the alerting system, led to a small but statistically significant increase in IV usage and lab tests. The values used for the alerting system were found to have no statistically significant difference in the context of different ICU wards since data from the laboratory tests serve as the primary early indicator of septic shock by confirming the presence of toxins.

Predicting the Need For Vasopressors in the Intensive Care Unit Using an Attention Based Deep Learning Model,"Kwak, Gloria Hyunjung; Ling, Lowell; Hui, Pan","BACKGROUND: Previous models on prediction of shock mostly focused on septic shock and often required laboratory results in their models. The purpose of this study was to use deep learning approaches to predict vasopressor requirement for critically ill patients within 24 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission using only vital signs. METHOD(S): We used data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III database and the eICU Collaborative Research Database to develop a vasopressor prediction model. We performed systematic data preprocessing using matching of cohorts, oversampling, and imputation to control for bias, class imbalance, and missing data. Bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), a multivariate time series model, was used to predict the need for vasopressor therapy using serial physiological data collected 21 h prior to prediction time. RESULT(S): Using data from 10,941 critically ill patients from 209 ICUs, our model achieved an initial area under the curve of 0.96 (95% CI 0.96-0.96) to predict the need for vasopressor therapy in 2 h within the first day of ICU admission. After matching to control class imbalance, the Bi-LSTM model had area under the curve of 0.83 (95% CI 0.82-0.83). Heart rate, respiratory rate, and mean arterial pressure contributed most to the model. CONCLUSION(S): We used Bi-LSTM to develop a model to predict the need for vasopressor for critically ill patients for the first 24 h of ICU admission. With attention mechanism, respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were identified as key sequential determinants of vasopressor requirements.Copyright Â© 2020 by the Shock Society.",2021,,"Shock (Augusta, Ga.)",56,1,73-79,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SHK.0000000000001692,,#3788,Kwak 2021,Exclusion reason: Not sepsis ; ,""
"Early Prediction of Mortality, Severity, and Length of Stay in the Intensive Care Unit of Sepsis Patients Based on Sepsis 3.0 by Machine Learning Models","Su, Longxiang; Liu, Shengjun; Wang, Hao; Li, Dongkai; Chen, Huan; Zhou, Xiang; Long, Yun; Xu, Zheng; Chang, Fengxiang; Ma, Yingying; Hong, Na; Jiang, Huizhen; Zhu, Weiguo","Background: Early prediction of the clinical outcome of patients with sepsis is of great significance and can guide treatment and reduce the mortality of patients. However, it is clinically difficult for clinicians. Method(s): A total of 2,224 patients with sepsis were involved over a 3-year period (2016-2018) in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. With all the key medical data from the first 6 h in the ICU, three machine learning models, logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, were used to predict mortality, severity (sepsis/septic shock), and length of ICU stay (LOS) (>6 days, <= 6 days). Missing data imputation and oversampling were completed on the dataset before introduction into the models. Result(s): Compared to the mortality and LOS predictions, the severity prediction achieved the best classification results, based on the area under the operating receiver characteristics (AUC), with the random forest classifier (sensitivity = 0.65, specificity = 0.73, F1 score = 0.72, AUC = 0.79). The random forest model also showed the best overall performance (mortality prediction: sensitivity = 0.50, specificity = 0.84, F1 score = 0.66, AUC = 0.74; LOS prediction: sensitivity = 0.79, specificity = 0.66, F1 score = 0.69, AUC = 0.76) among the three models. The predictive ability of the SOFA score itself was inferior to that of the above three models. Conclusion(s): Using the random forest classifier in the first 6 h of ICU admission can provide a comprehensive early warning of sepsis, which will contribute to the formulation and management of clinical decisions and the allocation and management of resources.Â© Copyright Â© 2021 Su, Xu, Chang, Ma, Liu, Jiang, Wang, Li, Chen, Zhou, Hong, Zhu and Long.",2021,,Frontiers in Medicine,8,,664966,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.664966,,#3878,Su 2021,Exclusion reason:  Predicts sepsis / severe sepsis; Finneas Catling (2022-04-27 00:27:26)(Included): MK: suggest exclude as predicts severity as mixed bag of sepsis / SS / other stuff; ,""
Postoperative sepsis prediction in patients undergoing major cancer surgery,"Sood, A.; Abdollah, F.; Sammon, J. D.; Arora, N.; Weeks, M.; Peabody, J. O.; Menon, M.; Trinh, Q. D.","Background Cancer patients are at increased risk for postoperative sepsis. However, studies addressing the issue are lacking. We sought to identify preoperative and intraoperative predictors of 30-d sepsis after major cancer surgery (MCS) and derive a postoperative sepsis risk stratification tool. Methods Patients undergoing one of nine MCSs (gastrointestinal, urological, gynecologic, or pulmonary) were identified within the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (2005-2011, n = 69,169). Multivariable adjusted analyses (MVA) were performed to identify the predictors of postoperative sepsis. A composite sepsis risk score (CSRS) was constructed using the regression coefficients of predictors significant on MVA. The score was stratified into low, intermediate, and high risk, and its predictive accuracy for sepsis, septic shock, and mortality was assessed using the area under the curve analysis. Results Overall, 4.3% (n = 2954) of patients developed postoperative sepsis. In MVA, Black race (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30, P = 0.002), preoperative hematocrit <30 (OR = 1.40, P = 0.022), cardiopulmonary and cerebrovascular comorbidities (P < 0.010), American Society of Anesthesiologists score >3 (P < 0.05), operative time (OR = 1.002, P < 0.001), surgical approach (OR = 1.81, P < 0.001), and procedure type (P < 0.001) were significant predictors of postoperative sepsis. CSRS demonstrated favorable accuracy in predicting postoperative sepsis, septic shock, and mortality (area under the curve 0.72, 0.75, and 0.74, respectively). Furthermore, CSRS risk stratification demonstrated high concordance with sepsis rates, 1.3% in low-risk patients versus 9.7% in high-risk patients. Similarly, 30-d mortality rate varied from 0.5% to 5.5% (10-fold difference) in low-risk patients versus high-risk patients. Conclusions Our study identifies the major risk factors for 30-d sepsis after MCS. These risk factors have been converted into a simple, accurate bedside sepsis risk score.

On computer-aided prognosis of septic shock from vital signs,"Ogul, H.; Baldominos, A.; Asuroglu, T.; Colomo-Palacios, R.; Fibratel,; Grupo, Solutia; Hospital Universitario Reina, Sofia; Imibic,; The Technical Committee on Computational Life, Sciences","Sepsis is a life-threatening condition due to the reaction to an infection. With certain changes in circulatory system, sepsis may progress to septic shock if it is left untreated. Therefore, early prognosis of septic shock may facilitate implementing correct treatment and prevent more serious complications. In this study, we assess the feasibility of applying a computer-aided prognosis system for septic shock. The system is envisaged as a tool to predict septic shock at the time of sepsis onset using only vital signs which are collected routinely in intensive care units (ICUs). To this end, we evaluate the performances of computational methods that take the sequence of vital signs acquired until sepsis onset as input and report the possibility of progressing to a septic shock before any further clinical analysis is performed. Results show that an adaptation of multivariate dynamic time warping can reveal higher accuracy than other known time-series classification methods on a new dataset built from a public ICU database. We argue that the use of computational intelligence methods can promote computer-aided prognosis of septic shock in hospitalized environment to a certain degree.

Data analytics and clinical feature ranking of medical records of patients with sepsis,"Chicco, Davide; Oneto, Luca","Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening clinical condition that happens when the patient's body has an excessive reaction to an infection, and should be treated in one hour. Due to the urgency of sepsis, doctors and physicians often do not have enough time to perform laboratory tests and analyses to help them forecast the consequences of the sepsis episode. In this context, machine learning can provide a fast computational prediction of sepsis severity, patient survival, and sequential organ failure by just analyzing the electronic health records of the patients. Also, machine learning can be employed to understand which features in the medical records are more predictive of sepsis severity, of patient survival, and of sequential organ failure in a fast and non-invasive way. Dataset and methods: In this study, we analyzed a dataset of electronic health records of 364 patients collected between 2014 and 2016. The medical record of each patient has 29 clinical features, and includes a binary value for survival, a binary value for septic shock, and a numerical value for the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. We disjointly utilized each of these three factors as an independent target, and employed several machine learning methods to predict it (binary classifiers for survival and septic shock, and regression analysis for the SOFA score). Afterwards, we used a data mining approach to identify the most important dataset features in relation to each of the three targets separately, and compared these results with the results achieved through a standard biostatistics approach. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): Our results showed that machine learning can be employed efficiently to predict septic shock, SOFA score, and survival of patients diagnoses with sepsis, from their electronic health records data.

Development and Verification of a Digital Twin Patient Model to Predict Specific Treatment Response During the First 24 Hours of Sepsis,"Lal, Amos; Li, Guangxi; Cubro, Edin; Chalmers, Sarah; Li, Heyi; Herasevich, Vitaly; Dong, Yue; Pickering, Brian W.; Kilickaya, Oguz; Gajic, Ognjen","To develop and verify a digital twin model of critically ill patient using the causal artificial intelligence approach to predict the response to specific treatment during the first 24 hours of sepsis. Design: Directed acyclic graphs were used to define explicitly the causal relationship among organ systems and specific treatments used. A hybrid approach of agent-based modeling, discrete-event simulation, and Bayesian network was used to simulate treatment effect across multiple stages and interactions of major organ systems (cardiovascular, neurologic, renal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, inflammatory, and hematology). Organ systems were visualized using relevant clinical markers. The application was iteratively revised and debugged by clinical experts and engineers. Agreement statistics was used to test the performance of the model by comparing the observed patient response versus the expected response (primary and secondary) predicted by digital twin. Setting: Medical ICU of a large quaternary- care academic medical center in the United States. Patients or Subjects: Adult (> 18 year yr old), medical ICU patients were included in the study. Interventions: No additional interventions were made beyond the standard of care for this study. Measurements and Main Results: During the verification phase, model performance was prospectively tested on 145 observations in a convenience sample of 29 patients. Median age was 60 years (54-66 d) with a median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 9.5 (interquartile range, 5.0-14.0). The most common source of sepsis was pneumonia, followed by hepatobiliary. The observations were made during the first 24 hours of the ICU admission with one-step interventions, comparing the output in the digital twin with the real patient response. The agreement between the observed versus and the expected response ranged from fair (kappa coefficient of 0.41) for primary response to good (kappa coefficient of 0.65) for secondary response to the intervention. The most common error detected was coding error in 50 observations (35%), followed by expert rule error in 29 observations (20%) and timing error in seven observations (5%). Conclusions: We confirmed the feasibility of development and prospective testing of causal artificial intelligence model to predict the response to treatment in early stages of critical illness. The availability of qualitative and quantitative data and a relatively short turnaround time makes the ICU an ideal environment for development and testing of digital twin patient models. An accurate digital twin model will allow the effect of an intervention to be tested in a virtual environment prior to use on real patients.",2020,,Crit Care Explor,2,11,e0249-e0249,,,,#6143,Lal 2020,Exclusion reason: No learnt component; Finneas Catling (2022-02-19 05:22:47)(Select): All elements of the model appear to be manually prespecified - I can't see that they fit any part of it to data; ,""

Earlier intravenous fluid resuscitation can significantly improve outcomes in septic patients but easily leads to fluid overload (FO), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. A single point value of fluid cannot provide enough fluid information. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of fluid balance (FB) latent trajectories on clinical outcomes in septic patients. Method(s): Patients were diagnosed with septic shock during the first 48 h, and sequential fluid data for the first 3 days of ICU admission were included. A group-based trajectory model (GBTM) which is designed to identify groups of individuals following similar developmental trajectories was used to identify latent subgroups of individuals following a similar progression of FB. The primary outcomes were hospital mortality, organ dysfunction, major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and severe respiratory adverse events (SRAE). We used multivariable Cox or logistic regression analysis to assess the association between FB trajectories and clinical outcomes. Result(s): Nine hundred eighty-six patients met the inclusion criteria and were assigned to GBTM analysis, and three latent FB trajectories were detected. 64 (6.5%), 841 (85.3%), and 81 (8.2%) patients were identified to have decreased, low, and high FB, respectively. Compared with low FB, high FB was associated with increased hospital mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22-2.17], organ dysfunction [odds ratio (OR) 2.18, 95% CI 1.22-3.42], MAKE (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.04-2.63) and SRAE (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.46-3.71), and decreasing FB was significantly associated with decreased MAKE (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29-0.79) after adjustment for potential covariates.

Evaluating recommender systems for AI-driven biomedical informatics,"Cava, William La; Williams, Heather; Fu, Weixuan; Vitale, Steve; Srivatsan, Durga; Moore, Jason H.","Motivation: Many researchers with domain expertise are unable to easily apply machine learning to their bioinformatics data due to a lack of machine learning and/or coding expertise. Methods that have been proposed thus far to automate machine learning mostly require programming experience as well as expert knowledge to tune and apply the algorithms correctly. Here, we study a method of automating biomedical data science using a web-based platform that uses AI to recommend model choices and conduct experiments. We have two goals in mind: first, to make it easy to construct sophisticated models of biomedical processes; and second, to provide a fully automated AI agent that can choose and conduct promising experiments for the user, based on the user's experiments as well as prior knowledge. To validate this framework, we experiment with hundreds of classification problems, comparing to state-of-the-art, automated approaches. Finally, we use this tool to develop predictive models of septic shock in critical care patients. Results: We find that matrix factorization-based recommendation systems outperform meta-learning methods for automating machine learning. This result mirrors the results of earlier recommender systems research in other domains. The proposed AI is competitive with state-of-the-art automated machine learning methods in terms of choosing optimal algorithm configurations for datasets. In our application to prediction of septic shock, the AI-driven analysis produces a competent machine learning model (AUROC 0.85 +/- 0.02) that performs on par with state-of-the-art deep learning results for this task, with much less computational effort.",2019,,,,,,,,,#37,Cava 2019,Exclusion reason: Not for realtime use; Finneas Catling (2022-03-21 20:42:26)(Select): Vague description of what is being predicted - seems just to predict risk of septic shock within a whole ICU admission so not very useful in guiding treatment; ,""
Machine learning methods to improve bedside fluid responsiveness prediction in severe sepsis or septic shock: an observational study,"Bataille, Benoit; de Selle, Jade; Moussot, Pierre-Etienne; Marty, Philippe; Silva, Stein; Cocquet, Pierre","BACKGROUND: Passive leg raising (PLR) predicts fluid responsiveness in critical illness, although restrictions in mobilising patients often preclude this haemodynamic challenge being used. We investigated whether machine learning applied on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) data might be used as a tool for predicting fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients., METHODS: We studied, 100 critically ill patients (mean age: 62 yr [standard deviation: 14]) with severe sepsis or septic shock prospectively over 24 months. Transthoracic echocardiography measurements were performed at baseline, after PLR, and before and after a standardised fluid challenge in learning and test populations (n=50 patients each). A 15% increase in stroke volume defined fluid responsiveness. The machine learning methods used were classification and regression tree (CART), partial least-squares regression (PLS), neural network (NNET), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Each method was applied offline to determine whether fluid responsiveness may be predicted from left and right cardiac ventricular physiological changes detected by cardiac ultrasound. Predictive values for fluid responsiveness were compared by receiver operating characteristics (area under the curve [AUC]; mean [95% confidence intervals])., RESULTS: In the learning sample, the AUC values were PLR 0.76 (0.62-0.89), CART 0.83 (0.73-0.94), PLS 0.97 (0.93-1), NNET 0.93 (0.85-1), and LDA 0.90 (0.81-0.98). In the test sample, the AUC values were PLR 0.77 (0.64-0.91), CART 0.68 (0.54-0.81), PLS 0.83 (0.71-0.96), NNET 0.83 (0.71-0.94), and LDA 0.85 (0.74-0.96) respectively. The PLS model identified inferior vena cava collapsibility, velocity-time integral, S-wave, E/Ea ratio, and E-wave as key echocardiographic parameters., CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning generated several models for predicting fluid responsiveness that were comparable with the haemodynamic response to PLR.

"Sepsis World Model: A MIMIC-based OpenAI Gym ""World Model"" Simulator for Sepsis Treatment","Kiani, Amirhossein; Wang, Chris; Xu, Angela","Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to an infection. In order to treat patients with sepsis, physicians must control varying dosages of various antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors based on a large number of variables in an emergency setting. In this project we employ a ""world model"" methodology to create a simulator that aims to predict the next state of a patient given a current state and treatment action. In doing so, we hope our simulator learns from a latent and less noisy representation of the EHR data. Using historical sepsis patient records from the MIMIC dataset, our method creates an OpenAI Gym simulator that leverages a Variational Auto-Encoder and a Mixture Density Network combined with a RNN (MDN-RNN) to model the trajectory of any sepsis patient in the hospital. To reduce the effects of noise, we sample from a generated distribution of next steps during simulation and have the option of introducing uncertainty into our simulator by controlling the ""temperature"" variable. It is worth noting that we do not have access to the ground truth for the best policy because we can only evaluate learned policies by real-world experimentation or expert feedback.

We show that our learned states, when combined with demographics and raw vital signs, improve prediction for most interventions even 4 or 8 hours ahead of onset. Our results are competitive with existing work while using a substantially larger and more diverse cohort of 36,050 patients.

An analytic tool for prediction of hemodynamic responses to vasopressors,"Bighamian, Ramin; Reisner, Andrew T.; Hahn, Jin-Oh","This paper presents a new analytic tool for automated control of vasopressor infusion, which uses measured changes in blood pressure to infer changes in the underlying cardiovascular system and then estimate dose-response relationships for the underlying cardinal cardiovascular parameters, i.e., those related to cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR). Ultimately, blood pressure as a function of vasopressor dose is predicted based on the estimated underlying cardiovascular state by extrapolating the dose-response relationship. As well, this tool adapts to individual subjects with a minimum of individualized training data. In this report, proof-of-principle is provided using experimental epinephrine dose-response data from four different sets of subjects. Given two observations from different infusion rates, the analytic tool was able to accurately predict the groups' blood pressure, heart rate, TPR, stroke volume, and CO as a function of vasopressor dose levels: the root-mean-squared prediction error for the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was consistently smaller than 5% of the underlying MAP; the r(2) values for the TPR, stroke volume, and CO were consistently higher than 0.96; and the limits of agreement between actual versus predicted blood pressure (BP), TPR, stroke volume, and CO were consistently smaller than 8% of the respective underlying values.

Method(s): During the retrospective study period, 83 renal recipients and 67 liver recipients developed BSIs. Risk factors for septic shock were identified by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Result(s): The mean age for these renal and liver transplant recipients with BSIs was 41.5 years (41.5 +/- 12.3 years) and 45.7 years (45.7 +/- 13.0 years), respectively.

Inferior vena cava collapsibility index is a valuable and non-invasive index for elevated general heart end-diastolic volume index estimation in septic shock patients,"Zhao, J.; Wang, G.","Background: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the inferior vena cava respirophasic variation (IVC collapsibility index [IVCCI]) and the general heart end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI). By determining the above relationship, we could evaluate the utility of IVCCI as an indicator. Material/Methods: Forty-two septic patients were finally enrolled in this study. The inferior vena cavaâs diameter was measured with the largest at the end of expiration (IVC3) and with the smallest at the end of inspiration (IVCi) on the ultrasound (IVCCI=[(IVCD e-IVCD i)/IVCD e] Ã100%). The central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac index (CI), and GEDVI were also measured at least 3 times. After fluid resuscitation therapy, the patients with a CI increase induced by more than 15% and less than 15% were classified as the positive response group (PRG) and the negative response group (NRG), respectively. Results: After treatment, the average levels of CVP, CI, and GEDVI were significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) in both groups, whereas the IVCCI was reduced. CVP, CI, and GEDVI were negatively correlated with IVCCI in both groups. The correlation coefficient between IVCCI and GEDVI was the greatest (correlation coefficient in the PRG group was 0.889 and in the NRG group it was 0.672). The ROC curve analysis indicated that IVCCI illustrated the best area under the curve, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100%, and a cut-off value of 12.9% to predict GEDVI &lt;600 ml/m2 in the PRG group.

Cardiac troponins I and T are biological markers of left ventricular dysfunction in septic shock,"Ver Elst, Kristien M.; Spapen, Herbert D.; Nguyen, Duc Nam; Huyghens, Luc P.; Garbar, Christian; Gorus, Frans K.","Background: Cardiac depression in severe sepsis and septic shock is characterized by left ventricular (LV) failure. To date, it is unclear whether clinically unrecognized myocardial cell injury accompanies, causes, or results from this decreased cardiac performance. We therefore studied the relationship between cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) and LV dysfunction in early septic shock. Method(s): Forty-six patients were consecutively enrolled, fluid-resuscitated, and treated with catecholamines. Cardiac markers were measured at study entry and after 24 and 48 h. LV function was assessed by two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography. Result(s): Increased plasma concentrations of cTnI (>=0.4 mug/L) and cTnT (>=0.1 mug/L) were found in 50% and 36%, respectively, of the patients at one or more time points. cTnI and cTnT were significantly correlated (r = 0.847; P <0.0001). Compared with cTnI-negative patients, cTnI-positive subjects were older, presented higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores at diagnosis, and tended to have a worse survival rate and a more frequent history of arterial hypertension or previous myocardial infarction. In contrast, the two groups did not differ in type of infection or pathogen, or in dose and type of catecholamine administered. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in all patients and autopsy in 12 nonsurvivors did not disclose the occurrence of acute ischemia during the first 48 h of observation. LV dysfunction was strongly associated with cTnI positivity (78% vs 9% in cTnI-negative patients; P <0.001). In multiple regression analysis, both cTnI and cTnT were exclusively associated with LV dysfunction (P <0.0001). Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that in septic shock, clinically unrecognized myocardial cell injury is a marker of LV dysfunction. The latter condition tends to occur more often in severely ill older patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. Further studies are needed to determine the extent to which myocardial damage is a cause or a consequence of LV dysfunction.

Y.; Usman, J.","Early treatment of sepsis can reduce mortality and improve a patient condition. However, the lack of clear information and accurate methods of diagnosing sepsis at an early stage makes it become a significant challenge. The decision to start, continue or stop antimicrobial therapy is normally base on clinical judgment since blood cultures will be negative in the majority of cases of septic shock or sepsis. However, clinical guidelines are still required to provide guidance for the clinician caring for a patient with severe sepsis or septic shock. Guidelines based on patientâs unique set of clinical variables will help a clinician in the process of decision making of suitable treatment for the particular patient. Therefore, biomarkers for sepsis diagnosis with a reasonable sensitivity and specificity are a requirement in ICU settings, as a guideline for the treatment. Moreover, the biomarker should also allow availability in real-time and prediction of sepsis progression to avoid delay in treatment and worsen the patient condition.

Color Doppler ultrasound based on artificial intelligence neural network was used to image and calculate cardiovascular ultrasound image information parameters (left ventricular outflow tract maximum peak flow rate (Vspeak), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LEDV), the maximum diameter of inferior vena cava (IVCe) and the minimum diameter of inferior vena cava (IVCi), cardiac output (CO), inferior vena cava collapse index (IVC-CI)) before and after treatment. The vital sign parameters (central venous pressure (CVP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), and heart rate (HR)) of patients were tested before and after treatment. The results showed that CVP(7.78mmHg), DBP (62.16mmHg), SBP (104.42mmHg), and MBP (76.21mmHg) after treatment were higher than before treatment, and HR (109.31 BPM) was lower than before treatment (P< 0.05). LEDV (65.02ml), IVCe (1.73cm), IVCi (0.93cm), CO (4.20l /min), and IVC-CI (0.59) were greater than those before treatment (P< 0.05). DBP, SBP, CVP, and CVC-CI of septic shock patients were significantly correlated with CVP (P< 0.01). Cardiovascular Doppler ultrasound took less time than central venous measurement. In conclusion, color Doppler ultrasound imaging based on artificial intelligence neural network can quantitatively evaluate the condition changes of infectious patients before and after treatment, which is safe, feasible, and taking less time.Copyright Â© 2020.

Optimal Timing for Vasopressor Initiation in Septic Shock : Revisiting the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines using Machine Learning,"Waschka, A.; Komorowski, M.; Hubbard, A.; Pirracchio, R.","INTRODUCTION. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign [1] recommends to administer 30 ml/kg of fluid within 3 hours following the onset of hypotension, before introducing vasopressors. However, evidence supporting this recommendation is lacking. OBJECTIVES. Determine i) the optimal timing and ii) the optimal fluid volume before vasopressor introduction in septic shock. METHODS. We used the data from the MIMIC II dataset. (2) To be included, patients had to present an acute hypotensive episode of septic origin and a lactate level > 2 mmol/l. The primary outcome measure was hospital mortality. We used a machine learning approach accounting for time-varying confounders called longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation. (3) RESULTS. 933 patients were included: SOFA 7; arterial lactate 3.3 mmol/L, average hospital mortality rate 11.5%. Hospital mortality was significantly minimized when vasopressors where introduced by hour 3 following the onset of hypotension. When compared to 30 ml/kg, switching to vasopressors after 5 or 10 ml/kg was associated with reduced mortality (Fig. 1). CONCLUSION. In septic shock, administering 5-10 ml / kg within 3 hours after the onset of hypotension appears to maximize the chance of survival.

"Guided Fluid-balance Optimization With Mini-fluid chALlenge During Septic Shock: A Multicenter, Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomized Trial","","Many observational studies have highlighted an independent association between fluid overload and clinical outcomes during septic shock. To optimize fluid balance, clinician has several options to consider carefully fluid administration and avoid fluid overload. More than a general restrictive approach, a pragmatic, individual tailored approach should be considered to optimize patients' hemodynamics during acute circulatory failure. Many advances in hemodynamic monitoring were described. Mini-fluid challenge appears to be a sensible method to use for bedside assessment to optimize fluid infusion. The next step for hemodynamic management in the ICU should be to test a hemodynamic goal-directed approach to better control fluid management and eventually improve patient's outcome. The main objective of the GOAL study is to evaluate a pragmatic optimization fluid management protocol tailored to each patient's hemodynamic status based on mini-fluid challenges. This intervention will be compared to usual management based on the latest guidelines. This intervention aims to decrease organ dysfunction during septic shock. This is the first large clinical trial designed to test this hypothesis.",2018,"March 6, 2018",ClinicalTrials.gov,,,,,,,#627,,Exclusion reason: Clinical trial withdrawn; ,""
Predictors of early progression to severe sepsis or shock among emergency department patients with nonsevere sepsis,"Gupta, Namita; Lulaj, Elizabeth; Furgiuele, Miriam; Gennis, Paul; Birnbaum, Adrienne; Hidalgo, Idaly; Jones, Michael P.; Jolly, Tiphany; Holder, Andre L.","Background: Progression from nonsevere sepsis-i.e., sepsis without organ failure or shock-to severe sepsis or shock among emergency department (ED) patients has been associated with significant mortality. Early recognition in the ED of those who progress to severe sepsis or shock during their hospital course may improve patient outcomes. We sought to identify clinical, demographic, and laboratory parameters that predict progression to severe sepsis, septic shock, or death within 96 h of ED triage among patients with initial presentation of nonsevere sepsis. Method(s): This is a retrospective cohort of patients presenting to a single urban academic ED from November 2008 to October 2010. Patients aged 18 years or older who met criteria for sepsis and had a lactate level measured in the ED were included. Patients were excluded if they had any combination of the following: a systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg upon triage, an initial whole blood lactate level >=4 mmol/L, or one or more of a set of predefined signs of organ dysfunction upon initial assessment. Disease progression was defined as the development of any combination of the aforementioned conditions, initiation of vasopressors, or death within 96 h of ED presentation. Data on predefined potential predictors of disease progression and outcome measures of disease progression were collected by a query of the electronic medical record and via chart review. Logistic regression was used to assess associations of potential predictor variables with a composite outcome measure of sepsis progression to organ failure, hypotension, or death. Result(s): In this cohort of 582 ED patients with nonsevere sepsis, 108 (18.6 %) experienced disease progression. Initial serum albumin <3.5 mg/dL (OR 4.82; 95 % CI 2.40-9.69; p < 0.01) and a diastolic blood pressure <52 mmHg at ED triage (OR 4.59; 95 % CI 1.57-13.39; p < 0.01) were independently associated with disease progression to severe sepsis or shock within 96 h of ED presentation. There were no deaths within 96 h of ED presentation. Conclusion(s): In our patient cohort, serum albumin <3.5 g/dL and an ED triage diastolic blood pressure <52 mmHg independently predict early progression to severe sepsis or shock among ED patients with presumed sepsis.Copyright Â© 2016, Holder et al.",2016,,International Journal of Emergency Medicine,9,1,1-11,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12245-016-0106-7,,#2263,Gupta 2016,"Exclusion reason:  Predicts sepsis / severe sepsis; Zuzanna Bien (2022-02-08 01:33:33)(Select): outcome was 'disease progression' - a composite measure which included, but was not exclusive to, septic shock. exclude? ; ",""
Physiological modelling and multivariable SOFLC of drug administration for critically IU patients,"King, O. K.; Mahfouf, M.; Ross, J. J.; Denai, M.","A compartmental model is modified to simulate the capillary leak associated with Sepsis and Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB). Sepsis refers to a systemic inflammatory response to bacterial infection. This involves continuously updating the oncotic pressures with regard to the flows in and out of each compartment. As a result, it is possible to model the effects of administering fluids with different oncotic pressures on filtration. The model allows for simulated infusions of vasoactive and inotropic drugs with a range of sensitivities to these drugs, giving a comprehensive platform for testing various control strategies. Furthermore, self-organising fuzzy logic control (SOFLC), drug sensitivity estimation, linear decoupling and noise filtering were used to control this system in a multivariable control scheme.

"Right data, right now-robust external validation of a deep reinforcement learning model to optimize hemodynamic treatment of critically ill patients with sepsis","Roggeveen, L.; Guo, T.; Fleuren, L.; Thoral, P. J.; Girbes, A.; Elbers, P. W. G.; Eiben, A. E.; Hoogendoorn, M.","INTRODUCTION. Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection [1]. Sepsis leads to haemodynamic changes, low blood pressure and insufficient tissue oxygenation. To determine whether a patient has received 'adequate fluid resuscitation' or needs vasopressor therapy, no criteria can be explicitly specified. Furthermore, it is recommended to individualize the target blood pressure during shock resuscitation [2]. Truly, there is a need for a more personalised treatment protocol. In 2017, Raghu et al. developed a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to determine optimal treatment policies for septic patients by using a continuous state space reinforcement learning model [3]. Their model was developed on data 24hours prior to 48hours after the onset of sepsis. They found that their model could reduce patient mortality in the hospital. To the best of our knowledge, no external validation of this model design has been performed. OBJECTIVES. To perform a clinical external validation of reinforcement learning models for the haemodynamic treatment of sepsis. The goal is to evaluate whether a reinforcement learning model could improve sepsis treatment if incorporated in an intensive care clinical workflow. METHODS. We perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis of reinforcement learning for sepsis treatment. Due to data limitations, we redeveloped a double deep duelling Q-learning model on the US based on Raghu's design on the MIMIC dataset. We applied the model to a new Dutch dataset of over 4000 critically ill patients treated in the ICU between 2003 and 2016. We perform robust external validation by assessing model performance and transferability under clinically applicable inclusion criteria on two time periods with different data granularity. Furthermore, we develop a sparse model based on physiological parameters only to investigate the importance of severity scores in relation to transferability. We quantify the performance using the weighted doubly robust (WDR) estimator and the weighted importance sampling (WIS) methods. RESULTS. Physician performance on the MIMIC dataset was 9.2 (WDR) and 7.8 (WDR) on the Dutch dataset consistent with the higher observed mortality in the Dutch dataset. Further results of the model performance are pending. CONCLUSION. Reinforcement learning based model performance varies across different patient populations. It is possible to develop a model based on sparse physiological parameters only. It is vital to evaluate model performance under clinical settings that simulate how a model would be incorporated into a clinical workflow. Model performance should be robust against conceptual drift; differences in data granularity, treatment plans and patient populations. More research is needed to evaluate model performance before such models can be applied in a clinical setting and potentially help reduce ICU mortality.",2019,,Intensive Care Medicine Experimental,7,Supplement 3,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40635-019-0265-y,,#3228,Roggeveen 2019,Exclusion reason: Poster / oral presentation; ,""

L.; Huber, W.; Perel, A.; Fernandez-Mondejar, E.; Molnar, Z.","Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is receiving increasing interest in modern ICU. The purpose of this project was to develop an application software for guiding hemodynamic decision support in critically ill patients. Method(s): We validated a dataset of 634 data lines containing hemodynamic variables and treatment options. We selected nine hemodynamic variables as inputs. Furthermore, data were collected regarding underlying conditions: heart failure, septic shock, renal failure or respiratory failure or a combination. We applied DataStories regression on the dataset (Turnhout, Belgium, www.datastories.com). Six different interventions were analyzed as KPI: administration or removal of fluids, increasing or decreasing inotropes and increasing or decreasing vasopressors. Finally, we elaborated and challenged 63537 predictive models to generate a decision algorithm to predict each KPI. We first looked at how each hemodynamic parameter impacts the prediction of each KPI individually and performed a standard correlation analysis as well as a more involved analysis of the mutual information content between each KPI and all other hemodynamic parameters individually. Confusion matrix and variable importance was obtained for each KPI. Result(s): The baseline hemodynamic parameters were: GEDVi 738+/-218 ml/m2, EVWLi 11.2+/-5.5 ml/kg PBW, SVV 14.8+/-8 %, MBP 77.8+/-16.5 mmHg, HR 94.2+/-23.5 bpm, CI 3.3+/-1.2 L/min.m2. The results of the regression analysis identified the different variables of importance for each of the different interventions (Fig 1A). Based on these results the hemodynamic variables (HR, MBP, GEDVI, ELWI, CI, SVV) were used to develop the final HemoGuide prediction model (Fig 1B). Conclusion(s): The HemoGuide app can be used to advise physicians with respect to basic therapeutic decisions at the bedside or as an educational tool for students. With the collection of new data, the accuracy of the system may grow over time.

Dynamic programming for solving a simulated clinical scenario of sepsis resuscitation,"Zhang, Zhongheng; Zhang, Xiaodian; Gu, Shenhong; Xu, Xiaoqing; Jiang, Wei; Lv, Chuanzhu; Zheng, Shaojiang","BACKGROUND: A major challenge in clinical research is population heterogeneity and we need to consider both historical response and current condition of an individual in considering medical decision making. The idea of precise medicine cannot be fully accounted for in traditional randomized controlled trials. Reinforcement learning (RL) is developing rapidly and has found its way into various fields including clinical medicine in which RL is employed to find an optimal treatment strategy. The key idea of RL is to optimize the treatment policy depending on the current state and previous treatment history, which is consistent with the idea behind dynamic programming (DP). DP is a prototype of RL and can be implemented when the system dynamics can be fully quantified. METHOD(S): The present article aims to illustrate how to perform DP algorithm in a clinical scenario of Sepsis resuscitation. The state transition dynamics are constructed in the framework of Markov Decision Process. The state space is defined by mean arterial pressure (MAP) and lactate; the action space is comprised of fluid administration and vasopressor. The implementation of policy evaluation, policy improvement and iteration are explained with R code. RESULT(S): the DP algorithm was able to find the optimal treatment policy depending on the current states and previous conditions. The iteration process converged at finite steps. We defined several functions such as nextStep(), policyEval() and policy_iteration() to implement the DP algorithm. CONCLUSION(S): This article illustrates how DP can be used to solve a clinical problem. We show that DP is a potential useful tool to tailor treatment strategy to patients with different conditions/states.

Predictors of progression to septic shock in patients meeting clinical criteria for severe sepsis,"Whiles, Bristol; Deis, Amanda; Simpson, Steven","PURPOSE: To determine identifiable risk factors associated with increased risk of progression of severe sepsis to septic shock. METHOD(S): We developed a retrospective cohort study of severe sepsis patients >=18 years of age admitted through the University of Kansas Hospital emergency department (ED) between 3/1/2007 - 9/30/2015. Severe sepsis was identified by an ICD- 9 diagnosis code (995.92) or by clinical criteria with acute organ dysfunction at >=2 organ sites. Inclusion criteria also required a diagnosed infection, antibiotic administration within 24 hours of ED triage, and recorded length of hospital stay and discharge disposition. The presence of septic shock on presentation at our facility was defined as any of the following within 3 hours of ED triage: 1) systolic blood pressure >90mmHg, 2) mean arterial pressure <65, or 3) vasopressor administration. Since we were interested in the progression of severe sepsis to septic shock, patients with shock on presentation were removed from our study. Progression to septic shock was defined as administration of a vasopressor subsequently during the same hospitalization. Chisquared, t-test, and multivariate regression modeling was used to determine variables predictive of progression from severe sepsis to septic shock. RESULT(S): A total of 8623 patients with severe sepsis were identified, with an average age of 60.1 +/- 16.8 years (mean +/- SD) and including 4480 (52.0%) males. Of these patients, 632 (7.33%) progressed to septic shock during their hospitalization. Age, gender, race, BMI, and Charlson Age-Comorbidity Index were similar among those without and with progression to septic shock. Progression to shock was associated with increased hospital LOS, and increased rates of ICU admission, mortality, and 30-day readmission (7.9 +/- 8.2 days vs 15.5 +/- 13.7 days, p<.0001; 30.1% vs 91.3%, p<.0001 ; 4.1% vs 25.47%, p<.0001). SOFA score and number of infection sites were higher among patients with progression to septic shock vs patients without progression (5.53 +/- 3.13 vs 3.01 +/- 2.12, p<.0001; 2.2 +/- 0.92 vs 1.92 +/- 0.89, p<.0001). Specific organ dysfunction types associated with increased risk of progression to septic shock included respiratory and hematologic dysfunction (DIC) (p<.05). Infections most predictive of progression included pulmonary, bacteremia, abdominal, and iatrogenic infections (p<.05). Comorbid conditions associated with increased risk of progression included coagulopathies, fluid and electrolyte disorders, lymphoma, and weight loss (p<.05).

Diagnostic Investigation and Prediction of Shock (The DiPS Study),"Timothy H Rainer, M. D.","Background to the research Patients present to Emergency Departments (ED) with a spectrum of illness, many of which are life- threatening. The body has the ability to compensate in the early stages when things go wrong so that on the surface patients do not appear as sick as they really are. Under-diagnosis of severity of illness leads to under-treatment, unnecessary mortality, and unnecessary hospital costs. Earlier diagnosis and consequent treatment will result in prudent healthcare, cost-benefit and better patient outcomes. Evaluating the true underlying patient haemodynamics such as cardiac output, cardiac power and peripheral pressures gives vital clues to the hidden seriousness of illness and is a guide to better management. Few EDs in the world assess such haemodynamics. After evaluating a haemodynamic protocol one centre in Australia was able to reduce its death rate for septic shock at 30 days from 38% to 7%. We would like to evaluate whether the same would occur if applied across EDs in Wales. However, before we can do that we need to strengthen our understanding of haemodynamics, and of relevant protocols and non-invasive devices that help us to acquire such information. Study Design After ethics and institutional approval is obtained from we will conduct a prospective, single-centre, cohort study on 354 adult patients with possible shock associated with an acute illness or injury who present to the Emergency Department of the University Hospital of Wales, and follow them up for 7 days. 354 is a credible number to confirm that the strategy works.

Safe Reinforcement Learning for Sepsis Treatment,"Jia, Y.; Burden, J.; Lawton, T.; Habli, I.","Sepsis, a life-Threatening illness, is estimated to be the primary cause of death for 50,000 people a year in the UK and many more worldwide. Managing the treatment of sepsis is very challenging as it is frequently missed at an early stage and the optimal treatment is not yet clear. There are promising attempts to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn optimal strategies to treat sepsis patients, especially for the administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors. However, some RL agents only take the current state of patients into account when recommending the dosage of vasopressors. This is inconsistent with clinical safety practice in which the dosage of vasopressors is increased or decreased gradually. A sudden major change of the dosage might cause significant harm to patients and as such is considered unsafe in sepsis treatment. In this paper, we have adapted one of the deep RL methods published previously and evaluated whether the learned policy contains these sudden, major changes when recommending the vasopressor dosage.

Patterns of modified shock indices between survivors and nonsurvivors across cohorts of similar vasopressor equivalents,"Falini, S.; Angelotti, G.; Greco, M.; Cecconi, M.; Morandini, P.; Barbieri, R.; Chiti, A.","INTRODUCTION. Sepsis is a severe condition in which a patient's hemodynamics are compromised in response to a generalized infectious insult(1). Its prognosis is often ill-fated, and various indices have been investigated to predict response to therapy, including the shock index (SI), a ratio of systolic pressure (SP) and heart rate (HR)(2). We hypothesize that modified shock indices based on the diastolic (DP), mean (MP), or pulse pressure (PP) could be as good in predicting survival in sepsis. OBJECTIVES. The purpose of the analysis was to compare the discriminative ability of modified shock indices with regard to response to therapy of septic patients. METHODS. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care version III (MIMIC-III)(3) database was used for the analysis. Patients in the 18- 89 age range, admitted for at least 48 hours and fulfilling the international consensus sepsis-3 criteria(4) were included. In-ICU mortality was chosen as a surrogate outcome for response to therapy, and patients dying within 48 hours from admission were excluded. Clinical data relative to the first 6 hours of ICU stay were used to formulate predictions. Patients were stratified in 5 subcohorts of increasing severity using mean dosage of vasopressor equivalents (VPE), and divided in survivors (S) and non-survivors (D). The discriminative ability of SI, diastolic shock index (DSI = DP/HR), mean shock index (MSI = MP/HR) and pulse pressure shock index (PPSI = PP/HR) was compared. In addition, machine learning models including routinely measured values were built and validated for outcome prediction. RESULTS. A common pattern was observed when plotting the mean of the selected indices across the 5 subcohorts of patients (figures 1- 4): none was able to distinguish between survivors and nonsurvivors in the 'no vasopressor' subcohort, while a significant difference appeared in the 'low VPE' subcohorts (with survivors showing higher values than nonsurvivors), becoming again non significant for higher VPEs. For MP and DP, a significant difference was found in the 'very high VPE' sub-cohort, although reversed for survival classes (i.e. with survivors showing lower index values than nonsurvivors). Machine learning models considering these indices and other routinely measured values showed poor discrimination. CONCLUSION. All modified shock indices significantly stratify survivors and nonsurvivors of sepsis on low vasopressor dose, suggesting that they could be used to predict the response to or guide the treatment with vasopressors in the early phases of septic shock. Indices based on MP and DP also significantly stratify septic patients receiving very high VPE.",2019,,Intensive Care Medicine Experimental,7,Supplement 3,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40635-019-0265-y,,#3051,Falini 2019,Exclusion reason: Poster / oral presentation; ,""

Result(s): Among the study cohort (mean age 31 [SD 14] years; 219 [62%] female) a three-class (i.e. three phenotype) model provided the optimal fit. Phenotype 1 was the most common (n=180; 51%) and included younger, predominantly HIV-uninfected patients with malaria and neurologic dysfunction; in phenotype 2 (n=151; 43%) patients were older and predominantly HIV-infected with disseminated tuberculosis, septic shock, and multiorgan dysfunction; in phenotype 3 (n=19; 6%) patients were also HIV-infected with hypoxemic respiratory failure and less tuberculosis and septic shock (Figures 1a-1b). In-hospital mortality (or need for transfer to national referral hospital due to illness severity) was higher in phenotypes 2 (21%; odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-7.3) and 3 (21%; OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.1-13.0) compared to phenotype 1 (7%). There was evidence that the effect of fluid resuscitation strategy (highmoderate volume vs. low) on in-hospital outcome differed by phenotype (p=0.04 for interaction). In phenotypes 1 and 3, mortality or transfer was higher among patients who received moderate-high volume resuscitation (11% vs. 6% and 60% vs. 7%, respectively); in phenotype 2, mortality or transfer was lower among patients who received moderate-high-volume resuscitation (17% vs. 23%). Conclusion(s): We identified three sepsis phenotypes in Uganda with unique host-pathogen profiles, patterns of organ dysfunction, outcomes, and potentially divergent responses to fluid resuscitation. Improved classification of sepsis heterogeneity in SSA is necessary to develop more precise diagnostic, anti-microbial, and resuscitation strategies.

Modifying the shock index does not improve septic shock prediction in patients with infection,"Tabaie, Azade; Nemati, Shamim; Holder, Andre L.","Introduction: Initial shock index (SI) assessment (heart rate/ systolic blood pressure) has been associated with higher morbidity and mortality in the critically ill septic patients. SI does not incorporate measures of vasomotor tone, which is associated with poor outcomes in sepsis. The objective of this study is to determine if SI modification using diastolic blood pressure (DBP) or mean arterial pressure (MAP) would improve the prognostic utility of the shock index among infected ICU patients. Method(s): Data were collected retrospectively from the electronic medical records of patients from medical and surgical ICUs in 2 hospitals within the Emory Healthcare system. Adult patients (aged 18 years or older) were included in this analysis if they had new suspicion for infection during an ICU stay, defined as either of the following: (1) any antibiotic administration, followed by any cultures (blood, urine, sputum/BAL, CSF, etc.), within 24 hours of each other; or (2) any cultures, followed by any antibiotic administration, within 72 hours of each other. Infection onset was defined as the time of the first event. The first value of every clinical and laboratory variable after sepsis onset were used in this study. Regularized logistic regression models were created both with and without adjusting for time-variant and demographic information to predict if a patient developed shock within six hours of the first infection time. Sensitivity threshold was fixed at 0.85 in order to perform pairwise comparison between the AUCs (z-test). Result(s): There were 8116 patients eligible for inclusion. SI modification (through use of DBP or MAP) did not statistically significantly improve the association with risk of future septic shock (p = 0.81 & 0.96). Moreover, controlling for time-variant and demographic information did not improve the predictive power of SI-DBP or SI-MAP (p = 0.87 & 0.83). Conclusion(s): Modification of the SI does not improve the prediction of future septic shock within the six hours of infection time. Further studies with high-resolution waveforms is needed to see if better documentation of blood pressure could result in improved prediction of septic shock[1].",2018,,Shock,49,6 Supplement 1,138,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/SHK.0000000000001158,,#2919,Tabaie 2018,Exclusion reason: Poster / oral presentation; ,""
Evaluation of the diagnostic effect of sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) on septic shock: A Retrospective analysis of clinical database MIMIC-III and multicenter data,"Lui, K.; Cai, C.","INTRODUCTION. In the Sepsis 3.0 definition, sepsis is only divided into 2 groups: sepsis and septic shock. Septic shock is still one of the most major causes of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death in the world[1,2]. However, in Sepsis 3.0, it didn't tell us what the accurate mean of adequate fluid resuscitation and provide an objective and detectable indicator in septic patients. OBJECTIVES. Our aim in the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic effect of SOFA on septic shock in septic patients. METHODS. Firstly, we conducted a retrospective study of patients with sepsis diagnosis admitted to the ICU using the MIMIC-III database. They were divided into septic shock and non-shock based on ICD-9 and SOFA>=2. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to find out the independent risk factors affecting the incidence of septic shock. ROC curve was used to analyze those risk factors, SOFA, qSOFA, SAPS and SAPSII. What's more, we collected clinical data of sepsis and septic shock patients from three different hospitals within 24 hours after admission. SOFA, qSOFA, SAPS II and APACHE II were also compared with ROC curve analysis. RESULTS. A total of 5724 patients were enrolled in MIMIC-III, with 2811 in septic shock group and 2913 in non-septic shock. The result of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that lactate and SOFA were the independent risk factors (p<0.05). The result of ROC analysis showed that the AUC of pH-value, lactate and BUN were 0.587, 0.553 and 0.539. SOFA had the best predictive effect with the statistical results of AUC (0.643) (95%CI 0.550- 0.723, p=0.001), sensitivity (0.620), specificity (0.600); and also shown that SOFA >=7 meant the patients have supposed to be septic shock. Secondly, SOFA, qSOFA, SAPS II and APACHE II were also compared with ROC by our multicenter data. A total 216 patients were enrolled in our data, with 80 septic shock group and 136 in sepsis. It also shown that SOFA have a higher diagnostic efficiency (AUC=0.687, 95%CI 0.550-0.723, sensitivity=0.727, specificity= 0.601, p=0.002) than qSOFA (AUC=0.666, 95%CI 0.582- 0.750, p<0.001), SAPS II (AUC=0.642, 95%CI 0.559-0.724, p=0.001) and APACHE II (AUC=0.642, 95%CI 0.558-0.727, p=0.001) within 24 hours after admission. It also indicated that SOFA >=8 meant the patients have supposed to be septic shock CONCLUSION. SOFA score is the best choice for diagnosing the possibility of septic shock. Our findings suggest that the SOFA>=8 within 24 hours after admission in ICU provides better diagnostic effect for septic shock in septic patients.",2019,,Intensive Care Medicine Experimental,7,Supplement 3,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40635-019-0265-y,,#3152,Lui 2019,Exclusion reason: Poster / oral presentation; ,""
Modeling to individualize mean arterial pressure threshold to prevent acute kidney injury in the ICU,"Pacheco, Ricardo; Salgado, Catia; Deliberato, Rodrigo; Celi, Leo Anthony; Sousa, Joao; Vieira, Susana","Learning Objectives: Urine output is used to guide fluid resuscitation and is one of the criteria for the diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI). The mean arterial pressure (MAP) plays a crucial role in the renal blood flow and consequently in the glomerular filtration rate. The aim of this project is to determine the MAP threshold that would predict a critical drop in the urine output (UO) (<= 30 mL/h) in a mixed ICU population. Method(s): We performed a retrospective study using MIMIC- III (Medical Information Mart for intensive Care), an open-access deidentified database with over 60,000 intensive care unit (ICU) admissions to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, USA from 2001 to 2012. All patients with ICU stay longer than 24 hours and without chronic renal disease were included. Hourly MAP and UO measurements were retrieved. Each UO reading, categorized as either > or < 30 ml/h, was mapped to preceding MAP determinations. A grid search was performed, optimizing a MAP threshold for each patient, using the area under the receiving operator curve (AUC) as a performance metric. The MAP threshold with the highest AUC was considered the patient's optimal threshold. Result(s): 9670 patients were analyzed; 4212 patients developed sustained oliguria that met the criteria for AKI (37.7% within 6 hours and 77% within 48 hours of ICU admission). Of the AKI cohort, 38.7% has a diagnosis of sepsis and a similar proportion was on vasopressor agents. Although 92% exhibited an optimal threshold above 60 mmHg and 62% a threshold above 70 mmHg, the MAP the hour before a UO measurement is not sufficient to predict oliguria (UO < 30 ml/hr). Conclusion(s): No clear MAP threshold is identified even when patients are categorized according to age, vasopressor administration, hypertension history or sepsis diagnosis. Neural network models that include more variables, such as patient demographics, fluid balance, mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use are being employed along with feature selection algorithms to further elucidate the relationship between blood pressure and UO in predicting oliguria.",2016,,Critical Care Medicine,44,12 Supplement 1,109,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000508810.24919.2c,,#2343,Pacheco 2016,Exclusion reason: Poster / oral presentation; ,""
Sepsis electronic surveillance and clinical outcomes: Impact over mortality of a sepsis early detection electronic rule implemented in the emergency department,"Martin-Rico, P.; Marco-Lattur, M.

Therapeutic guidelines can improve mortality, but early recognition and timely implementation of these requires a proactive attitude that can be electronically supported. Method(s): From May 2013 our hospital implemented a Sepsis Code (SC) based on an early detection electronic rule developed by our multiprofessional sepsis team: clinicians and IT engineers (EMR Cerner Millennium platform) and a standardized order set plus systematic follow-up by our sepsis team. We performed a before-after study to assess the impact over mortality of this strategy. Time-series analysis of sepsis admissions and mortality from January 2011 to December 2013, before and after SC implementation. (Analysis by STATA.) All urgent admissions recorded in the minimum basic data set in patients over 14 years from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2013 were included. Inclusion criteria: patients with ICD-9 sepsisassociated codes in the principal diagnosis or patients with infectionassociated codes in the principal diagnosis together with sepsis-associated codes in secondary diagnosis. Medical records were manually reviewed by clinicians to confirm SS/SS diagnosis. Temporal series analysis (Poisson regression). First analysis: sepsis admissions in relation to total urgent admissions. Second analysis: deaths due to SS/SS related to admissions in this group. In both cases we compared results before SC activation (28 months) and after that (first 2 transitional months and 6 consolidated months). The multivariate adjustment in both analyses included year, month of the year, and months with activated rule. Graphic analysis estimated predictions for the last 8 months based on the previous 28 months, comparing both observed and predicted sepsis and deaths. Result(s): A total of 24,118 urgent admissions were included, 5,657 in the postalert period. Mean monthly admissions: 652 (SD 47) (570 to 740). In total, 408 and 178 SS/SS were identified in the prealert and postalert period, respectively. After SC implementation we observed no significant changes in sepsis admission risk but a clear downward trend in sepsis mortality: in the first 2 transitional months we did not observe major changes, while in the last 6 months the risk of death does fall 36% reaching statistical significance (IRR 0.64 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.97, P = 0.036)) (Table 1 Figures 1 and Figure 2). Both antibiotic door-to-needle time and adequacy significantly improved in sepsis cases where the alert was triggered. Conclusion(s): Implementation of a SC triggered by an electronic detection alert, compared to the prealert period, decreased mortality risk by 36% (IRR 0.64 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.97, P = 0.036)) with the rule fully implemented.",2014,,Critical Care,18,SUPPL. 2,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/cc14024,,#1926,Martin-Rico 2014,Exclusion reason: Poster / oral presentation; Finneas Catling (2021-09-29 02:18:30)(Screen): At FT analysis: find out if they predicted septic shock using a data-driven method; ,""
Use of heart rate variability to assess illness severity in emergency department patients with sepsis,"Barnaby, Douglas; Ferrick, Kevin; Gallagher, E. John; Kim, Ryung; Bijur, Polly","Background: Early identification and risk stratification of patients presenting to the ED with sepsis can reduce morbidity and mortality. Prior work has shown that Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis of brief ECG recordings might help rapidly and non-invasively identify patients at increased risk of short-term deterioration. Objective(s): To examine the ability of HRV analysis to identify patients at increased risk of early deterioration. Method(s): Prospective cohort study of a convenience sample of ED patients satisfying 1992 SCCM/ACCP criteria for sepsis. Potential patients were identified through clinician referral and an electronic sepsis order set, then screened for enrollment by trained research assistants 24 hours/day, 7 days/week. In addition to recording baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory variables, enrolled patients had bedside ECG Holter monitoring performed for approximately 15 minutes. ECG recordings were analyzed off line to obtain the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power (LF/HF ratio). Patients were followed for 72 hours to identify those meeting one or more of the study endpoints, defined as requiring intubation, non-invasive ventilation, vasopressor/inotrope support, critical care unit admission, or death within 72 hours of ED presentation. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association between altered HRV and subsequent deterioration after adjusting for clinically relevant variables. Result(s): Of 278 enrolled patients presenting to the ED with sepsis who were subsequently admitted to the hospital, 36 (13%) reached one or more study endpoints within 72 hours of presentation. Patients with a LF/HF ratio < 1 had an odds ratio (OR) of 4.3 (95% CI [1.9, 6.6]) for achieving a study endpoint. After adjusting for age, sex, history of CHF, and mean heart rate, patients with a LF/HF ratio < 1 had an adjusted OR of 3.0 (95% CI [1.4, 6.5]) for achieving a study endpoint.

Trajectory Inspection: A Method for Iterative Clinician-Driven Design of Reinforcement Learning Studies,"Ji, Christina X.; Oberst, Michael; Kanjilal, Sanjat; Sontag, David","Reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential to significantly improve clinical decision making. However, treatment policies learned via RL from observational data are sensitive to subtle choices in study design. We highlight a simple approach, trajectory inspection, to bring clinicians into an iterative design process for model-based RL studies. We identify where the model recommends unexpectedly aggressive treatments or expects surprisingly positive outcomes from its recommendations. Then, we examine clinical trajectories simulated with the learned model and policy alongside the actual hospital course. Applying this approach to recent work on RL for sepsis management, we uncover a model bias towards discharge, a preference for high vasopressor doses that may be linked to small sample sizes, and clinically implausible expectations of discharge without weaning off vasopressors. We hope that iterations of detecting and addressing the issues unearthed by our method will result in RL policies that inspire more confidence in deployment.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of patients â¥18 admitted to two urban hospitals with a combined ED census of 162,000. Study cases included patients with severe sepsis/septic shock admitted via the ED. Controls comprised admissions without severe sepsis/septic shock. Using multivariate logistic regression, a prediction rule was constructed. The model's AUROC was internally validated using 1000 bootstrap samples. Results: 143 study and 286 control patients were evaluated. Features predictive of severe sepsis/septic shock included: SBP â¤ 110 mm Hg, shock index/SI â¥ 0.86, abnormal mental status or GCS < 15, respirations â¥ 22, temperature â¥ 38C, assisted living facility residency, disabled immunity.

In this study, we show that predictive performance improves by employing a minimum pre-processing technique, the Zero-Order-Hold (ZOH) method, by applying a Fuzzy C-Means clustering technique based on the partial distance calculation strategy (FCM-PDS) and by computing the final classification regarding the samples from each patient. Performance improvements continue to occur where up to approximately 60% of the data is missing, though for higher percentage the classification performance still is statistically improved.

Many studies have leveraged their complementary effects by using a stack of neural network layers with CNN on the input, followed by RNN layers for the output. However, the feature representations learned by these two types of neural networks are often hard to be visualized and interpreted in a unified way. In this work, we propose a general framework which represents the extracted temporal relationships and local patterns in a unified and systematic way through facial representations that have evolving emotional expressions based on a patient's health conditions.

Predictors of septic shock in patients with obstructive pyelonephritis due to ureteral calculi,"Friedlander, Justin; Antonelli, Jodi; Mollengarden, Daniel; Adams-Huet, Beverley; Shoss, Jeffrey; Trimmer, Clayton; Kalva, Sanjeeva; Lotan, Yair; Pearle, Margaret","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Obstructive pyelonephritis due to renal/ureteral calculi is a urologic emergency requiring urgent decompression of the collecting system. However, despite prompt intervention, some patients still do poorly. We sought to determine predictors of septic shock in patients presenting with obstructing stones and infection. METHOD(S): With institutional review board approval, we identified 259 patients who underwent urgent drainage (stent or nephrostomy) for an obstructing stone in the setting of presumed infection between December 2008 and October 2013. We divided patients into two groups, those who did and those who did not develop septic shock during hospitalization, and we compared baseline parameters at the time of presentation as well as time to intervention. Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using Wilcoxon Rank Sum for continuous variables and Fisher's Exact for categorical variables. Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to determine independent predictors of septic shock. RESULT(S): Among the 259 study patients, 30 (11.6%) were diagnosed with septic shock after presentation. No significant differences in demographic factors were found between groups. The univariate analyses comparing parameters between groups are listed in the Table 1. On multivariable analysis, after controlling for the parameters listed at the bottom of the table, every one-unit increase in leukocyte count and heart rate portended a 7% and 3% increase in septic shock, respectively. Serum creatinine, while admittedly related to the diagnosis of shock, was associated with a 2.1 fold higher likelihood of developing septic shock. Furthermore, those with a previous history of stones were 73% less likely to develop shock. CONCLUSION(S): Among patients undergoing drainage for obstructive pyelonephritis due to stones, those who developed shock exhibited more significant abnormalities at presentation, consistent with greater severity of illness. Correlating presenting vital signs and laboratory values with shock risk will help to further identify those patients at highest risk with the hope that early identification will lead to better outcomes.

Left ventricular-arterial coupling as a predictor of stroke volume response to norepinephrine in septic shock - a prospective cohort study,"Zhou, Xiaoyang; Pan, Jianneng; Wang, Yang; Wang, Hua; Xu, Zhaojun; Zhuo, Weibo","Background: Left ventricular-arterial coupling (VAC), defined as the ratio of arterial elastance (Ea) to left ventricular end-systolic elastance (Ees), is a key determinant of cardiovascular performance. This study aims to evaluate whether left VAC can predict stroke volume (SV) response to norepinephrine (NE) in septic shock patients. Method(s): This was a prospective cohort study conducted in an intensive care unit of a tertiary teaching hospital in China. We recruited septic shock patients who had persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and required NE to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mmHg. Those patients in whom the target MAP was not reached after NE infusion were ineligible. Echocardiographic variables were measured before (baseline) and after NE infusion. SV responder was defined by a >= 15% increase in SV after NE infusion. Result(s): Of 34 septic shock patients included, 19 (56%) were SV responders. Before NE infusion, SV responders had a lower Ees (1.13 +/- 0.24 mmHg/mL versus 1.50 +/- 0.46 mmHg/mL, P = 0.005) and a higher Ea/Ees ratio (1.47 +/- 0.40 versus 1.02 +/- 0.30, P = 0.001) than non-responders, and Ea in SV responders was comparable to that in non-responders (1.62 +/- 0.36 mmHg/mL versus 1.43 +/- 0.28 mmHg/mL, P = 0.092). NE significantly increased Ea and Ees in both groups. The Ea/Ees ratio was normalized by NE administration in SV responders but unchanged in non-responders. The baseline Ea/Ees ratio was positively correlated with NE-induced SV increases (r = 0.688, P < 0.001).

Validation of the Artificial Intelligence-Based Predictive Optimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk (POTTER) Calculator in Emergency General Surgery and Emergency Laparotomy Patients,"El Hechi, Majed W.; Maurer, Lydia R.; El Moheb, Mohamad; Velmahos, George C.; Kaafarani, Haytham M. A.; Levine, Jordan; Zhuo, Daisy; Dunn, Jack; Bertsimas, Dimitris","Background: The Predictive Optimal Trees in Emergency Surgery Risk (POTTER) tool is an artificial intelligence-based calculator for the prediction of 30-day outcomes in patients undergoing emergency operations. In this study, we sought to assess the performance of POTTER in the emergency general surgery (EGS) population in particular. Method(s): All patients who underwent EGS in the 2017 American College of Surgeons NSQIP database were included. The performance of POTTER in predicting 30-day postoperative mortality, morbidity, and 18 specific complications was assessed using the c-statistic metric. As a subgroup analysis, the performance of POTTER in predicting the outcomes of patients undergoing emergency laparotomy was assessed. Result(s): A total of 59,955 patients were included. Median age was 50 years and 51.3% were women. POTTER predicted mortality (c-statistic = 0.93) and morbidity (c-statistic = 0.83) extremely well. Among individual complications, POTTER had the highest performance in predicting septic shock (c-statistic = 0.93), respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation for 48 hours or longer (c-statistic = 0.92), and acute renal failure (c-statistic = 0.92). Among patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, the c-statistic performances of POTTER in predicting mortality and morbidity were 0.86 and 0.77, respectively. Conclusion(s): POTTER is an interpretable, accurate, and user-friendly predictor of 30-day outcomes in patients undergoing EGS. POTTER could prove useful for bedside counseling of patients and their families and for benchmarking of EGS care.Copyright Â© 2021 American College of Surgeons",2021,,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,232,6,912,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2021.02.009,,#3742,ElHechi 2021,Exclusion reason: Not for realtime use; ,""
The intensive care infection score - a novel marker for the prediction of infection and its severity,"van der Geest, Patrick J.; Mohseni, Mostafa; Groeneveld, A. B. Johan; Linssen, Jo; Duran, Servet; de Jonge, Robert","Background: The prediction of infection and its severity remains difficult in the critically ill. A novel, simple biomarker derived from five blood-cell derived parameters that characterize the innate immune response in routine blood samples, the intensive care infection score (ICIS), could be helpful in this respect. We therefore compared the predictive value of the ICIS with that of the white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) for infection and its severity in critically ill patients. Method(s): We performed a multicenter, cluster-randomized, crossover study in critically ill patients between January 2013 and September 2014. Patients with a suspected infection for which blood cultures were taken by the attending intensivist were included. Blood was taken at the same time for WBC, ICIS, CRP and PCT measurements in the control study periods. Results of imaging and cultures were collected. Patients were divided into groups of increasing likelihood of infection and invasiveness: group 1 without infection or with possible infection irrespective of cultures, group 2 with probable or microbiologically proven local infection without blood stream infection (BSI) and group 3 with BSI irrespective of local infection. Septic shock was assessed. Result(s): In total, 301 patients were enrolled. CRP, PCT and ICIS were higher in groups 2 and 3 than group 1. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for the prediction of infection was 0.70 for CRP, 0.71 for PCT and 0.73 for ICIS (P < 0.001). For the prediction of septic shock the AUROC was 0.73 for CRP, 0.85 for PCT and 0.76 for ICIS. These AUROC did not differ from each other. Conclusion(s): The data suggest that the ICIS is potentially useful for the prediction of infection and its severity in critically ill patients, non-inferiorly to CRP and PCT. In contrast to CRP and PCT, the ICIS can be determined routinely without extra blood sampling and lower costs, yielding results within 15 minutes.

Baroreflex Sensitivity and Blood Pressure Variability can Help in Understanding the Different Response to Therapy during Acute Phase of Septic Shock,"Carrara, Marta; Baselli, Giuseppe; Ferrario, Manuela; Bollen Pinto, Bernardo; Bendjelid, Karim","Background: Mean values of hemodynamic variables are poorly effective in evaluating an actual recovery of the short-term autonomic mechanisms for blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) regulation. The aim of this work is to analyze the response to therapy in the early phase of septic shock to verify possible associations between BP recovery and BP autonomic control. Method(s): This is an ancillary study from the multicenter prospective observational trial Shockomics (NCT02141607). A total of 21 septic shock patients were studied at two time points during the acute phase of shock and were classified according to changes in SOFA score. Time series of BP components and HR were analyzed in time and frequency domain. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was assessed, and a mathematical model for the decomposition of diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) oscillations was used to understand the different contributions of BRS and HR on peripheral vascular resistance control. Result(s): Only those patients, who significantly improved organ function (responders, R), showed an increase of mean value and low frequency (LF) power in BP time series. Fluid accumulation was higher in the non-responders (NR). BRS increased in NR and the model of DAP variability showed that the contribution of HR was highly reduced in NR. Conclusion(s): Although patients reached the mean BP target of 65 mmHg, our analyses highlighted important differences in terms of autonomic nervous system control. BP variability, HR variability and baroreflex trends can add information to individual vital sign measure such as mean BP, and can help in understanding the responsiveness to the combination of symphatomimetic drugs and fluid therapy.Copyright Â© 2018 The Author(s).

Predicting the progression to septic shock in patients with a candida bloodstream infection,"Roth, Justin; Micek, Scott; Arnold, Heather; Hampton, Nicholas","Learning Objectives: Few data describe the clinical course of candidemia. This study assessed risk factors associated with the progression of candidemia to septic shock (SS). We hypothesized candidemic patients with greater baseline comorbidity or immunogenic drug exposure were more likely to progress to SS. Method(s): Between 2008-2012, all adult patients with a positive Candida blood culture (n=661) at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, MO were retrospectively identified. SS (n=86) was defined as vasopressor initiation between blood culture collection up to 72 hours after; non-shock (n=465) was defined as no vasopressors +/-7 days from culture collection. Patients requiring vasopressors before or >72 hours after culture collection were not included in the analysis. Result(s): SS patients were significantly older (60 +/- 14 vs. 56 +/- 16 yrs; p=0.04) and weighed more [80 (IQR 70-104) vs. 76 (IQR 61-94) kg; p=0.003]. Documented comorbidities were similar. Available data up to 8 days before candidemia showed SS patients had higher average blood glucose [157 (IQR 128-183) vs. 132 (IQR 114-161) mg/dL; p=0.02] and serum creatinine [1.52 (IQR 0.81-2.27) vs. 0.94 (IQR 0.64-1.63) mg/dL; p=0.002]. SS patients had more non-albicans candidemia (73.3% vs. 58.1%; p=0.01) with no difference in concurrent bacteremia. Prior to candidemia, there were no differences in topical antifungal usage; immunomodulating drug usage was similar except fewer SS patients received an anthracycline (1.2% vs. 7.7%; p=0.02). SS patients had more airway (14% vs. 3%; p<0.001), urinary (26% vs. 12%; p=0.002), and >1 colonization site (9.3% vs. 2.2; p=0.003). Multivariate regression found 3 independent predictors of progression to SS: weight (1-kg units) adjusted odds-ratio (AOR) 1.015 (95% CI 1.001-1.04), non-albicans candidemia AOR 3.1 (95% CI 1.3-7.3), airway colonization AOR 6.7 (95% CI 2.3-19.2).

Predicting fluid balance change in septic patients during deresuscitation,"Ahlsdorf, R.; Rahman, A.; Chang, Y.; Ghosh, E.; Peine, A.; Martin, L.","Introduction: Fluid overload resulting from suboptimal fluid management is common in critically ill patients and associated with adverse outcomes. Appropriate fluid management strategies to relieve fluid overload following the initial resuscitation period (the 'deresuscitation phase') are largely variable in clinical practice - potentially as a result of the heterogeneity in disease progression and numerous other factors, such as age and premorbidities. There is a need to better understand patients' progression in the deresuscitation phase and to accurately predict strategies in fluid balance management with the goal of guiding fluid therapy to achieve optimal fluid balance. Objective(s): We extracted fluid balance and physiological factors in the deresuscitation phase from a large cohort of patients with sepsis in a retrospective electronic health records database and built a machine learning model to predict fluid balance change periodically after patients had been stabilized. Method(s): We used MIMIC-III, a publicly available critical care dataset from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA. Our cohort consisted of adult ICU patients with sepsis (based on the Sepsis-III criteria) who received vasopressors and/or inotropes during resuscitation. We excluded patients with Do Not Resuscitate status, cardiac surgery and burn patients. End of resuscitation phase was defined as the time of last vasopressor/ inotrope administration. Clinical data including, demographics, vitals, labs, fluid inputs and outputs, interventions and medications were extracted for the time period starting from end of resuscitation to ICU discharge. Data was segmented into 4-hour blocks. Fluid balance was calculated for each block and the change (increase, no change or decrease) within a block evaluated. We trained a 3-class logistic regression model to predict the change of fluid balance in the next block using the extracted clinical data in the current block. Model was evaluated using 6-fold cross validation and top predictors were calculated. Result(s): A total of 2,565 ICU admissions were included in our cohort which was divided into 62,465 4-hour blocks. The mean area under receiver operator curve (AUROC) for predicting fluid balance increase was 0.78, mean AUROC for predicting no change in fluid balance was 0.71 and mean AUROC for predicting fluid balance decrease was 0.77. Conclusion(s): We trained a model to predict fluid balance change during deresuscitation in our cohort. The model performs reasonably well in distinguish patients with no change in fluid balance, a decrease, and an increase in fluid balance. Additionally, we identified top predictors for fluid balance change, which agree with known physiology. The top positive correlates for fluid balance decrease are being on CRRT and cumulative output. Conversely, being on CRRT is a negatively correlated with fluid balance increase. Therefore our model uses clinically meaningful features to distinguish between the different classes.",2020,,Intensive Care Medicine Experimental,8,SUPPL 2,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40635-020-00354-8,,#3333,Ahlsdorf 2020,Exclusion reason: Poster / oral presentation; Matthieu Komorowski (2022-01-26 04:36:17)(Select): doesnt involve fluids / vasopressors administration; ,""
Mapping multiscalar variability dynamics in 1/f physiologic phase space for tracking the state of sepsis patients,"Loparo, Kenneth A.; Vandendriessche, Benjamin; Abas, Mustafa; Dick, Thomas E.; Jacono, Frank J.","Objective Early diagnosis of patients at-risk for sepsis is paramount to their survival and recovery. However, identification of these patients is still based on snapshot observations, rather than on continuous data from real-time monitoring systems that can generate a high-resolution and comprehensive picture of the dynamical status of an individual patient. Quantifying changes in the nonlinear dynamics of physiologic waveforms can act as a proxy for a patients' status but significant hurdles have to be overcome to understand how neural control mechanisms drive these dynamics and how they are influenced by systemic inflammation and the resulting multiple organ dysfunction. Methods (A) A waveform database of sepsis patients with vasopressor dependency that includes: (1) continuous acquisition of high-resolution EKG, blood pressure and exhaled CO2 waveforms in a medical intensive care unit (MICU); (2) high-throughput physiologic feature extraction from multi-day waveform recordings via custom-developed software; and (3) generation of a comprehensive database of waveform features (including inter-beat intervals, respiratory phase transitions and measures of cardioventilatory coupling). (B) Constructing a physiologic phase space: (1) generation of a database of synthetic time series encompassing a wide spectrum of noise with 1/f spectral characteristics; (2) training an artificial neural network (ANN) to classify specific dynamical patterns in the synthetic time series in relation to progression of systemic inflammation, based on a proof-of-concept study in animal models of sepsis1; and (3) semi-continuous classification of patient variability pattern dynamics via the ANN. Results A tool was developed that maps the ANN classification results in a physiologic phase space to visualize transitions from (meta)stable to unstable time series dynamics. The phase space provides a fast and straightforward interpretation of the variability of complex dynamical patterns as they fluctuate with time. For the patient data analyzed to date, the presence of primarily unstable variability dynamics tracked significantly with in-hospital mortality (p < 0.05). Furthermore, state transitions from unstable to (meta)stable dynamics and v.v. tracked with certain MICU alarm triggering events.

Cause-Effect Deep Information Bottleneck For Systematically Missing Covariates,"Parbhoo, Sonali; Wieser, Mario; Wieczorek, Aleksander; Roth, Volker","Estimating the causal effects of an intervention from high-dimensional observational data is difficult due to the presence of confounding.

"Effect of lactate, catecholamine dose, and timing in patients with septic shock on vasopressin","Sacha, Gretchen; Lam, Simon; Duggal, Abhijit; Reddy, Anita; Bauer, Seth","Introduction/Hypothesis: Vasopressin (AVP) is recommended as an adjunct to norepinephrine for septic shock not at goal mean arterial pressure. Patients with a positive hemodynamic response to AVP have reduced mortality, yet how to predict who will respond is still unknown. This study sought to evaluate the effect of lactate, catecholamine (CA) dose and timing of AVP initiation on mortality in patients with septic shock who received AVP. Method(s): Retrospective, observational study of non-cardiac ICUs at a large academic medical center. Adult patients with CA dependent septic shock who received AVP were included. The primary goal was to compare quintiles (Q) of lactate at AVP initiation (Q1: 0.5-2.1 mmol/L, Q2: 2.1-3.2, Q3: 3.2-4.8, Q4: 4.8-8.2, Q5:8.2-30), CA dose at AVP initiation (Q1: 0.5-16 mcg/ min, Q2: 16-20, Q3: 20-30, Q3: 30-45, Q4: 45-440) and timing of AVP initiation (Q1: 0.13-1.5 hr, Q2: 1.5-3.8, Q3: 3.8-7.3, Q4: 7.3-14.2, Q5: 14.2-47) on hospital mortality. A multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine the association of lactate, CA dose and AVP initiation on mortality with adjustments for differences in baseline characteristics of survivors and non-survivors. Result(s): 1690 patients were included: 695 (41.1%) survived and 995 (58.9%) expired. The proportion of patients in each lactate, CA dose and timing Q was significantly different between survivors and non-survivors (P<0.01 for all). On multivariable logistic regression, lactate Q3-5 were significantly associated with mortality compared to Q1 (Q3 OR 1.6 [95% CI 1.1-2.2], Q4 OR 2.0 [1.4-2.9], Q5 OR 4.4 [2.9-6.7] all P<0.01).

Finally, timing Q5 of AVP initiation after shock onset was significantly associated with mortality compared to Q1 (Q5 OR 2.2 [95% CI 1.5-3.2] P<0.01). Conclusion(s): Increasing lactate, CA dose at AVP initiation and timing of AVP initiation after shock onset were all associated with increased mortality in patients with septic shock on AVP. When choosing to initiate AVP, this study showed improved outcomes when AVP was started early after shock onset, specifically in those with a lactate <3.2 mmol/L, CA dose <20 mcg/ min or when started within 14 hours of shock onset.",2020,,Critical Care Medicine,48,Supplement 1,14,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000618612.79888.a1,,#3597,Sacha 2020,Exclusion reason: Poster / oral presentation; ,""
Sepsis progression and outcome: A dynamical model,"Zuev, Sergey M.; Kingsmore, Stephen F.; Gessler, Damian D. G.","Background: Sepsis (bloodstream infection) is the leading cause of death in non-surgical intensive care units. It is diagnosed in 750,000 US patients per annum, and has high mortality. Current understanding of sepsis is predominately observational and correlational, with only a partial and incomplete understanding of the physiological dynamics underlying the syndrome. There exists a need for dynamical models of sepsis progression, based upon basic physiologic principles, which could eventually guide hourly treatment decisions. Result(s): We present an initial mathematical model of sepsis, based on metabolic rate theory that links basic vascular and immunological dynamics. The model includes the rate of vascular circulation, a surrogate for the metabolic rate that is mechanistically associated with disease progression. We use the mass-specific rate of blood circulation (SRBC), a correlate of the body mass index, to build a differential equation model of circulation, infection, organ damage, and recovery. This introduces a vascular component into an infectious disease model that describes the interaction between a pathogen and the adaptive immune system. Conclusion(s): The model predicts that deviations from normal SRBC correlate with disease progression and adverse outcome. We compare the predictions with population mortality data from cardiovascular disease and cancer and show that deviations from normal SRBC correlate with higher mortality rates.

Predicting early vasopressor independence with coarsely sampled arterial blood pressure in severe sepsis and septic shock,"Tate, Q.; Brown, S.; Jones, J. P.; Kuttler, K.; Li, Y.; Grissom, C.; Mathews, V.

Patterns within serial measures of vital signs may be useful, but true beat-to-beat data can be difficult to obtain, validate, and store. Whether moderately sampled heart rate and blood pressure will be of use is not known. Method(s): We prospectively identified septic patients through our sepsis screening logs and analyzed their heart rate and blood pressure as instantaneous values every 30 seconds. APACHE II score is calculated prospectively in all patients. Primary outcome was vasopressor independence at 24 hours. Secondary outcome was death at 30 days. We validated potential predictors with logistic regression. Result(s): We studied 46 patients, 23 of which were vasopressorindependent at 24 hours; 3 died. Increased variance of the systolic blood pressure measured over the first 6 hours of admission was associated with lower probability of being vasopressor independent at 24 hours (p<0.01) after controlling for mean systolic blood pressure, admission APACHE II score, and mean vasopressor dose. Effect modification was present between variance of systolic blood pressure and mean systolic blood pressure; stratified logistic regression suggested that the effect of increased variance of systolic blood pressure was observed (p<0.04) among patients with mean systolic blood pressure below 110 mm Hg.

Given the increasing number of physician/nurse handoffs of care, increasing amounts of information that the physician is asked to process, and increasing number of patients that are cared for by individual physicians, an EMR-based monitoring algorithm would provide a safety net to predict development of septic shock before ICU transfer, allowing for early intervention and improved outcomes. Hypothesis: Use of readily available longitudinal vital signs and laboratory values during the hospital admission can be used to build a prediction model for the development of septic shock before ICU (Intensive Care Unit) admission. Method(s): The study is based on a retrospective chart review from 2009 to 2010 at the UCLA Medical Center, involving the medical floor that takes care of patients with hematologic malignancies. Inclusion criteria included all adult patients > 18 years with a hematologic malignancy, typically being treated with chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation. Exclusion criteria included ICU admissions other than septic shock, DNR/DNI status. A predictive model was built using a neural network system using 50% of this cohort. The neural network system was built to distinguish between patients that were discharged home compared to patients that were admitted to the ICU for septic shock. Twenty five percent of the remaining cohort was used for cross-validation to fine-tune the performance of the neural network. Finally, the remaining 25% of the cohort was used for testing to determine real-world test statistics. Result(s): Five hundred sixty five consecutive admissions to the hematology malignancy ward were analyzed. The majority of these admissions were for chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation or neutropenic surveillance. The neural network's performance on the testing cohort demonstrated a 66.7% positive predictive value (compared to 5-10% using other methodologies) in identifying impending septic shock before its recognition by the clinicians on the ward. The median time to first alert was 11.76 days prior to transfer to the ICU, demonstrating the ability to identify septic shock earlier. Conclusion(s): Using readily available studies routinely obtained during admissions, a neural network based predictive model can predict septic shock prior to its occurrence in the hematologic malignancy ward.",2014,,American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,189,MeetingAbstracts,,,,,#1894,Hu 2014,"Exclusion reason: Not sepsis ; Finneas Catling (2022-02-08 00:39:10)(Select): They define clinical deterioration as cardiac arrest or transfer to ICU.

Using predictive models for clinical decision support,"Khalili, S.; Shukla, M.; Brostoff, N.; Sarkar, J.; Bartels, J.; Chang, S.","Background: Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) seek to better inform clinical care decisions through the use mathematical models and artificial intelligence algorithms. The disease states of intensive care unit (ICU) patients depend on the interactions between vital signs, organ function, and therapeutic interventions. Immunetrics is building a CDSS that assimilates such data to assess current patient status and predict future status. We posit that this tool should help clinicians choose among treatment options and detect important transitions in patient state. Method(s): Immunetrics has developed a proprietary multiscale mathematical model of the pathophysiology of inflammation and organ dysfunction in sepsis patients. This model mechanistically incorporates the effects of most ICU interventions, including antibiotics, vasopressors, fluids, and ventilation. Model predictions are not based on statisticsVthey are generated from personalized models trained to ICU data collected for each individual. We validate this model against retrospective data sets from several studies of CAP patients, studying quality of prediction for MAP, SpO2, and urine output. Result(s): We show that our model can successfully predict trends in patient markers during a several-hour time frame. Of particular interest, we find that themodel often correctly predicts the effects ofmanyinterventions before they are performed. Results indicate that themodel is well suited to guide care decisions such asweaning of vasopressors, changing ventilation support, and assessing volume status of sepsis patients.

Counterfactual Off-Policy Evaluation with Gumbel-Max Structural Causal Models,"Oberst, Michael; Sontag, David","We introduce an off-policy evaluation procedure for highlighting episodes where applying a reinforcement learned (RL) policy is likely to have produced a substantially different outcome than the observed policy. In particular, we introduce a class of structural causal models (SCMs) for generating counterfactual trajectories in finite partially observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We see this as a useful procedure for off-policy ""debugging"" in high-risk settings (e.g., healthcare); by decomposing the expected difference in reward between the RL and observed policy into specific episodes, we can identify episodes where the counterfactual difference in reward is most dramatic. This in turn can be used to facilitate review of specific episodes by domain experts.

Effect of norepinephrine challenge on cardiovascular determinants assessed using a mathematical model in septic shock: A physiological study,"He, Huaiwu; Yuan, Siyi; Long, Yun; Liu, Dawei; Zhou, Xiang; Ince, Can","Background: The present study investigated the cardiovascular determinants of cardiac output (CO), mean systemic filling pressure analogue (Pmsa) derived by Geoffrey Parkin, efficiency of heart (Eh) and related parameters to a norepinephrine (NE) challenge [an increase of 10 mmHg mean arterial pressure (MAP) by NE] in septic shock patients using of a mathematical model. Method(s): Twenty-seven septic shock patients with pulse index continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) monitoring were enrolled. These patients required NE to maintain an individualized MAP for organ perfusion after early fluid resuscitation based on their clinical condition. NE was decreased to obtain a decrease of 10 mmHg from base MAP (MAP-10mmHg), and the NE doses were adjusted to return MAP to baseline (MAPbase) and produce an increase of 10 mmHg from MAPbase (MAP+10mmHg). Two NE challenge episodes were analyzed for each patient: From MAP-10mmHg to MAPbase and from MAPbase to MAP+10mmHg. The Pmsa, pressure gradient for venous return (PGvr), and Eh (PGvr relative to Pmsa) were estimated using a mathematical model for the three MAP levels (MAP-10mmHg, MAPbase and MAP+10mmHg). Result(s): A total of 54 episodes of NE challenges were obtained in 27 patients. Significant and consistent increases were observed in the central venous pressure (CVP), Pmsa, and PGvr in response during the NE titration. DELTACO negatively and significantly correlated with DELTACVP (r=-0.722, P<0.0001), DELTAPmsa (r=-0.549, P<0.0001), DELTAResistance of venous return (Rvr) (r=-0.597, P<0.0001), and DELTAResistance of systemic vascular beds (Rsys) (r=-0.597, P<0.0001). Episodes of decreasing CO/Eh were associated with a higher DELTACVP than the CO/Eh-increasing episodes. The area under the curve (AUC) of DELTACVP to predict decreased CO by the incremental NE was 0.86, and the AUC of DELTACVP to predict decreased Eh was 0.94. A cutoff of DELTACVP >1.5 mmHg for detecting decreased CO resulted in a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 94.1%. A cutoff of DELTACVP >1.5 mmHg for detecting decreased Eh resulted in a sensitivity of 64.3% and a specificity of 100%. Conclusion(s): There were a highly divergent response in Eh and CO to afterload challenge episodes of an NE-induced 10mmHg increase in MAP. An increase in CVP may be an early alarm to identify the reduction in CO/Eh during an NE-induced increase of MAP.Copyright Â© 2021 AME Publishing Company.

This study was conducted to determine factors associated with hemodynamic response to fixed-dose vasopressin in patients with septic shock. Methods: Single-center, retrospective cohort of patients receiving fixed-dose vasopressin for septic shock for at least 6Â h with concomitant catecholamines in the medical, surgical, or neurosciences intensive care unit (ICU) at a tertiary care center. Patients were classified as responders or non-responders to fixed-dose vasopressin. Response was defined as a decrease in catecholamine dose requirements and achievement of mean arterial pressureÂ â¥Â 65Â mmHg at 6Â h after initiation of vasopressin. Results: A total of 938 patients were included: 426 responders (45%), 512 non-responders (55%).

Predictors of Acute Hemodynamic Decompensation in Early Sepsis: An Observational Study,"Lee, Young Im; Smith, Robert L.; Gartshteyn, Yevgeniya; Kwon, Sophia; Caraher, Erin J.; Nolan, Anna","BACKGROUND: The study of sepsis is hindered by its heterogeneous time course and evolution. A subgroup of patients with severe sepsis develops shock soon after the initiation of treatment while others present hypotensive. We sought to determine the incidence of hypotension after the initiation of treatment for sepsis, and characterize their clinical features and course., METHODS: A retrospective review of electronic medical record of all septic patients (n = 542) that met the definition of septic shock within 24 hours of admission (2011 - 2012) at an urban Veteran Affairs Hospital was performed. Subjects either had 1) initial normotension (INT) with hypotension developing within 24 hours or 2) initial hypotension (IH). Logistic regression was used to model associated factors of INT/IH., RESULTS: INT occurred in 62 patients (11%) with average initial blood pressure of 120/71 mm Hg and developed hypotension to 79/48 mm Hg. IH was identified in 52 patients (10%) with average presenting blood pressure of 81/46 mm Hg. INT showed evidence of increased sympathetic tone with significantly higher heart rate, blood pressure and temperature. INT patients were younger, more frequently on alpha-blockers, and more likely septic from pneumonia compared to IH patients. INT and IH patients had similar timing of antibiotic initiation, amount of 24-hour fluid resuscitation, vasopressor use, organ dysfunction and mortality at 28 days. Using alpha-blockers, being Caucasian, and having higher temperatures were independent predictors of INT., CONCLUSION: INT is a distinctive presentation of septic shock characterized by rapid deterioration during early treatment. By further studying this subgroup, mediators of septic shock may be identified that clarify pathophysiology and provide timely targeted treatment.",2016,,Journal of clinical medicine research,8,8,575-81,,https://dx.doi.org/10.14740/jocmr2597w,,#4334,Lee 2016,Exclusion reason: Doesn't guide CV treatment; Myura Nagendran (2022-01-18 02:52:44)(Select): I would exclude. feels associational rather than useful for treatment.; ,""

Method(s): A total of 100 ICU patients were included. The association between SA and the cumulative dose of noradrenaline was analyzed using logistic regression. For the total amount of fluids administered linear regression, for the lactate level and for 24 h mortality logistic regression was used. Age, gender, patient category, type of surgery, severe sepsis, lactate level, estimated glomerular filtration rate, c-reactive protein level, and the target mean arterial pressure were considered effect modifiers. Result(s): SA was significantly associated with the dose of noradrenaline (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84-0.99, p = 0.028), lower lactate levels (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.30, p = 0.049), and with the amount of fluids administered (B -0.02, 95% CI -0.03/-0.00, p = 0.016), but not with mortality (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85-1.07, p = 0.41).

Model Selection for Offline Reinforcement Learning: Practical Considerations for Healthcare Settings,"Tang, Shengpu; Wiens, Jenna","Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to learn treatment policies and aid decision making in healthcare. However, given the need for generalization over complex state/action spaces, the incorporation of function approximators (e.g., deep neural networks) requires model selection to reduce overfitting and improve policy performance at deployment. Yet a standard validation pipeline for model selection requires running a learned policy in the actual environment, which is often infeasible in a healthcare setting. In this work, we investigate a model selection pipeline for offline RL that relies on off-policy evaluation (OPE) as a proxy for validation performance. We present an in-depth analysis of popular OPE methods, highlighting the additional hyperparameters and computational requirements (fitting/inference of auxiliary models) when used to rank a set of candidate policies. We compare the utility of different OPE methods as part of the model selection pipeline in the context of learning to treat patients with sepsis. Among all the OPE methods we considered, fitted Q evaluation (FQE) consistently leads to the best validation ranking, but at a high computational cost. To balance this trade-off between accuracy of ranking and computational efficiency, we propose a simple two-stage approach to accelerate model selection by avoiding potentially unnecessary computation. Our work serves as a practical guide for offline RL model selection and can help RL practitioners select policies using real-world datasets.

Cardiac troponin I predicts myocardial dysfunction and adverse outcome in septic shock,"Mehta, Nirav J.; Khan, Ijaz A.; Gupta, Vipin; Jani, Ketan; Gowda, Ramesh M.; Smith, Peter R.","Objective: The objectives of this study were to determine myocardial injury in patients with septic shock by measuring serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI), to evaluate relationship between elevated cTnI and myocardial dysfunction and to determine if cTnI is a predictor of outcome in these patients. Method(s): Thirty-seven consecutive patients with septic shock were included in the study. Serum cTnI was measured at study entry and after 24 and 48 h. Transthoracic echocardiogram, electrocardiogram and regular biochemical and hemodynamic assessments were performed. Result(s): Sixteen (43%) patients had elevated serum cTnI. These patients had higher need for inotropic/vasopressor support (94% vs. 53%, p=0.018), higher APACHE II score (28 vs. 20, p=0.004), higher incidence of regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography (56% vs. 6%, p=0.002), lower ejection fraction (46% vs. 62%, p=0.04) and higher mortality (56% vs. 24%, p=0.04) compared to normal cTnI patients. By multiple logistic regression analysis, serum cTnI and APACHE II score were independent predictor of death and length of stay in intensive care unit. Serum cTnI, APACHE II score, anion gap and serum lactate were independent predictor of need for inotropic/vasopressor support. Receiver-operating characteristics of serum cTnI as a predictor of death in septic shock were significant. The elevated serum level of cTnI correlated with the lower left ventricular ejection fraction (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Myocardial injury can be determined in patients with septic shock by serum cTnI. Serum cTnI concentration correlates with myocardial dysfunction in septic shock. High serum cTnI predicts increased severity of sepsis and higher mortality. A close monitoring of patients with septic shock and elevated levels cTnI is warranted. Â© 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Characterizing Fluid Response and Sepsis Progression in Emergency Department Patients,"Gu, Qiao; Prasad, Varesh; Heldt, Thomas","Sepsis and septic shock are major global public health concerns. The main therapies for sepsis-related hypotension are fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy, though it can be challenging to determine the amount of fluid that should be given or the optimal timing to transition to vasopressor administration. To characterize patients' response to fluid bolus therapy (FBT) and analyze the sepsis progress using multiple vital signs, we mined a database containing 761 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with vital signs and laboratory values indicating high risk of septic shock. By clustering the patients' mean arterial pressure (MAP) time series during a time window around FBT, we found that clusters showing fluid responsiveness during the two hours after FBT only included about 25% of studied boluses. In addition, MAP responses tended to vary based on the initial MAP level. We also found that the trajectories of heart rate and MAP in a 2-D plane demonstrated general trends related to the hemodynamic progression of sepsis and previously described phases of septic shock. Potentially compensatory and decompensatory responses of the cardiovascular system to the insults of sepsis were reflected in the clusters representative of different phases.",2019,,Conference proceedings : ...

Machine learning in data abstraction: A computable phenotype for sepsis and septic shock diagnosis in the intensive care unit,"Dhungana, Prabij; Serafim, Laura Piccolo; Ruiz, Arnaldo Lopez; Bruns, Danette; Weister, Timothy J.; Smischney, Nathan Jerome; Kashyap, Rahul","BACKGROUND: With the recent change in the definition (Sepsis-3 Definition) of sepsis and septic shock, an electronic search algorithm was required to identify the cases for data automation. This supervised machine learning method would help screen a large amount of electronic medical records (EMR) for efficient research purposes., AIM: To develop and validate a computable phenotype via supervised machine learning method for retrospectively identifying sepsis and septic shock in critical care patients., METHODS: A supervised machine learning method was developed based on culture orders, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, serum lactate levels and vasopressor use in the intensive care units (ICUs). The computable phenotype was derived from a retrospective analysis of a random cohort of 100 patients admitted to the medical ICU. This was then validated in an independent cohort of 100 patients. We compared the results from computable phenotype to a gold standard by manual review of EMR by 2 blinded reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by a critical care clinician. A SOFA score >= 2 during the ICU stay with a culture 72 h before or after the time of admission was identified. Sepsis versions as V1 was defined as blood cultures with SOFA >= 2 and Sepsis V2 was defined as any culture with SOFA score >= 2. A serum lactate level >= 2 mmol/L from 24 h before admission till their stay in the ICU and vasopressor use with Sepsis-1 and-2 were identified as Septic Shock-V1 and-V2 respectively., RESULTS: In the derivation subset of 100 random patients, the final machine learning strategy achieved a sensitivity-specificity of 100% and 84% for Sepsis-1, 100% and 95% for Sepsis-2, 78% and 80% for Septic Shock-1, and 80% and 90% for Septic Shock-2. An overall percent of agreement between two blinded reviewers had a k = 0.86 and 0.90 for Sepsis 2 and Septic shock 2 respectively. In validation of the algorithm through a separate 100 random patient subset, the reported sensitivity and specificity for all 4 diagnoses were 100%-100% each., CONCLUSION: Supervised machine learning for identification of sepsis and septic shock is reliable and an efficient alternative to manual chart review.

"Closed-loop vasopressor controller robustness against variability in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and infusion line delay","Rinehart, J.; Ma, M.; Calderon, M.; Joosten, A.; Cannesson, M.","Background: There is growing evidence that intraoperative hypotension, both cumulative time and degree, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality post-operatively. In the ICU, treatment of hypotension has long been a priority in patient management. In both settings, vasopressor drips are frequently used to maintain mean arterial pressure, but our own research has shown that titration of these drips is frequently suboptimal, with 30% of time spent > 20mm Hg above reasonable target MAP and 10% of time spend >10mm below reasonable target MAP. Automatic titration is a task easily managed by computer, and we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a novel closed-loop controller for this task. Individual patients may exhibit differences in both dose response and drug elimination, however, so safe performance of such a system must be demonstrated across a plausible range of possible pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We sought to establish whether the current controller would still operate safely given such variability. Method(s): Using a previously established and validated physiologic simulation model, we modified the response to a generic alpha-agonist agent modeled after phenylephrine to include randomization of: 1) Potency, with a range of 1/5x to 3x typical response. The drug was modeled with a convex response curve (decreasing impact with increasing dose) and a median-dose for 50% full potential effect (MD50) inflection point of 625 micrograms as baseline, with a range of 150 - 1500 in the randomization. 2) Drug clinical effect half-time. Baseline was set to 150 seconds, with randomization range set from 90 to 300 seconds. 3) Infusion delay: 0 to 60 seconds between 'infusion' of a dose and clinical effect. The closed-loop controller was run on a separate laptop using the network to communicate dose to the simulator and receive back vital signs data in return. 500 Monte Carlo runs per condition were used as a reasonable sample to assess overall performance. Performance across the runs was compared to no management and management in the ""optimal"" PK/PD patient (MD50=625, half-time of 150s, 10s infusion line delay). A 30-minute 3-stage sepsis/vasodilatory scenario was used as the testing condition. Controller target was set to 70mm Hg, with 'acceptable' performance permitted from 68-75 mmHg. Result(s): Performance results for each condition are shown in Table 1. Spaghetti plots of mean arterial pressure over time are shown in Figure 1. Higher infusion line-lag was found to be the biggest contributor to overshoot, and low patient responsiveness the largest contributor to undershoot. Discussion(s): The controller remained stable in all runs (convergent on target over time). Performance degradation was relatively minor in the Variable condition, with most error coming from being overtarget.",2018,,Anesthesia and Analgesia,127,1 Supplement 1,105-106,,,,#2881,Rinehart 2018,Exclusion reason: Poster / oral presentation; Paul Festor (2021-11-26 22:47:14)(Select): Couldn't find available full text online.; ,""
Ultrasound assessment of carotid flow time and volume in predicting fluid responsiveness in patients with sepsis,"Liteplo, Andrew S.; Gouker, Stacy; Ratanski, Daniel; Diamond, Eden; Shokoohi, Hamid; Schleifer, Jessica; Huang, Calvin K.; Marill, Keith A.; Filbin, Michael R.","Background and Objectives: An increasing amount of evidence supports the use of carotid flow time (CFTc) and volume (CFV) for detecting volume status in patients with hypovolemia. We sought to assess whether sequential ultrasound measurements of CFTc and CFV permit an accurate prediction of fluid responsiveness in patients with sepsis Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in an academic Emergency Department over one year. Hypotensive (SBP<90) patients 'at risk' for sepsis (as defined by an ED Sepsis Screen Protocol) and in whom the plan was to treat with IV fluids were eligible for enrollment. IV fluid resuscitations and standard sepsis management were performed as routine clinical care. Ultrasound measurements of CBF and CFTc were performed at time zero and at two hours or upon completion of 30 mL/kg of IV fluid therapy. All ultrasound measurements were repeated after a passive leg raise (PLR) maneuver. Emergency physician sonographers were blinded to the clinical and laboratory findings. We recorded the correlation between sequential carotid flow measurements and inadequate fluid responsiveness defined as persistent hypotension requiring vasopressor administration within 12 hours of ED arrival. A Wilcoxon rank sum test and Lehmann Hodges median shift were used to compare interval data. Simple linear regression was used to assess correlation between interval data results Results: Among 69 patients the mean age was 66 years of age. 48% of patients were female. 36 patients were categorized as clinical fluid responders and 33 were non-responders. On the initial ultrasound, there was a significant increase in CFTc with PLR (9.7 ms, 95% CI 5.8 to 13.6). There was no significant change seen in CBF with PLR (3.3 mL/min, 95% CI -15.2 to 23.6). Change in CFTc and CFV, with or without PLR, were not predictive of fluid responsiveness (p=0.53 and 0.23 respectively). The changes in patient DELTACBF (p=0.74) and DELTACFTc (p=0.91) from initial ultrasound measurement to 2 hours were neither associated with the volume of weight-adjusted IVF administered nor with fluid responsiveness Conclusion(s): In patients with suspected sepsis, the lack of correlation between an increased CFTc and CFV and IV fluid volume suggested that it is unlikely that carotid flow parameters can determine patients who may benefit from further IV fluid therapy after initial fluid bolus.",2020,,Academic Emergency Medicine,27,Supplement 1,S95,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/acem.13961,,#3523,Liteplo 2020,Exclusion reason: Poster / oral presentation; ,""
Multimarker logistic regression models predict sepsis prior to onset of overt clinical symptoms,"Colon-Franco, J. M.; Anderson, D. A.; Litt, S.; Srinivasa Gowda, S.; Rice, T. W.; Wheeler, A. P.; Dupont, W. D.; Woodworth, A.","Background: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) along with a documented infection. Rapid diagnosis and early initiation of therapy significantly reduces mortality, but diagnosis during early stages of disease is difficult because many clinical conditions present with SIRS. No single biochemical or clinical marker can accurately identify early sepsis among patients with SIRS. Objective(s): To develop prediction models able to identify sepsis up to two days before overt clinical presentation of SIRS in Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) patients and to compare their diagnostic utilities to the only FDA approved sepsis biomarker, procalcitonin (PCT) Methods: This retrospective cohort study enrolled 201 MICU patients with SIRS who were identified by an electronic system that scans electronic medical records (EMRs) and alerts when patients meet >=2 SIRS criteria (temperature >38degreeC or <36degreeC, heart rate >90 beats/min, respiratory rate >20 breaths/min and white cell count >12x109 or <4x104). Residual plasma specimens sent to the VUMC core laboratory for metabolic panels one and/or two days before SIRS criteria were met (Days -1 and -2) were utilized. The biomarkers TNFalpha, IL-6, IL-10, CRP and LBP were quantified on the Immulite 1000 (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) and Procalcitonin (PCT) was quantified using the B R A H M S PCT assay in the VIDAS analyzer (Biomerieux, Durham, NC). Patient demographics, clinical and laboratory values were obtained through review of EMRs. Two MICU physicians, blinded to the biomarkers results, adjudicated noninfectious SIRS or sepsis as follows: SIRS, n=109 and sepsis, n=92 (among these, 42 had septic shock). Three logistic regression models containing different combinations of biomarkers, demographics, and laboratory values collected one or two days prior to onset of SIRS were generated for prediction of sepsis or septic shock; Model 1: baseline demographics, routine laboratory and clinical values, Model 2: highest concentration of biomarkers (days -1 and -2), and Model 3: combination of models 1 and 2. Areas under receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) were used to evaluate the diagnostic strength of the models and of the highest concentration of PCT on days -1 and -2. Result(s): The AUCs for PCT for the prediction of sepsis and septic shock before SIRS were 0.67 (p<0.0001) and 0.70 (p=0.0001), respectively. The AUCs for Models 1, 2 and 3 to predict sepsis before SIRS were 0.74 (p=0.0001), 0.77 (p<0.0001), and 0.81 (p<0.0001), respectively. The AUCs for Models 1, 2, and 3 to predict septic shock before SIRS were 0.76 (p=0.001), 0.82 (p<0.0001), and 0.87 (p<0.0001), respectively. Combining Models 1 and 2 significantly improved the individual diagnostic utilities of the models to predict early sepsis and shock (p=0.02 and p=0.001).

301 Use of Transfer Learning to Improve External Validity of a Machine-Learning Algorithm to Predict Septic Shock in the Emergency Department,"Wardi, G.; Shashikumar, S.; Carlile, M.; Krak, M.; Hayden, S.; Holder, A.; Nemati, S.","Study Objectives: Machine-learning (ML) algorithms have previously been shown to improve detection of sepsis over traditional models. Transfer learning, a new subset of ML, allows for generalizability of an algorithm at distinct clinical sites, improving external validity. We aim to validate the use of a ML algorithm for the prediction of delayed septic shock of patients with sepsis in the emergency department (ED) at a large university system and then demonstrate the ability of transfer learning to improve external validity at a geographically distinct second clinical location. Method(s): 2 academic hospital systems using patients encounters between 2014 and 2019. Types of Participants: Over 180,000 adult (age >= 18) patients who were admitted to the hospital from the ED were evaluated for sepsis. Cases of sepsis (using either ""Sepsis 3"" international consensus definition or severe sepsis using the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) definition) were identified via automated abstraction. Septic shock was defined as the earliest point a patient met criteria for sepsis and a titratable vasoactive medication was initiated. Patients were excluded if they were discharged from the ED, had an ED length of stay < 3 hours, or developed shock within 4 hours of ED triage. Design(s): Observational cohort study using data from electronic health record data from ED patient encounters using multiple definitions of sepsis. We used a Weibull-Cox proportional hazards model (the ML algorithm) to predict delayed septic shock at varying prediction windows (up to 36 hours prior to the event) using 40 commonly available input features consisting of vital signs and laboratory results easily available to the end-user. Data from hospital system A (the ""development"" site) was used for model training and hospital system B (the ""validation"" site) was used to evaluate the ML algorithm at a second site. During external validation at hospital system B, the pre-trained ML algorithm derived from data at the development site was fine-tuned on the training subset at the validation site, using 20 iterations of a gradient descent algorithm (transfer learning) to demonstrate generalizability of the algorithm. Result(s): 18,499 patients met criteria for CMS severe sepsis at the development site and 6,409 at the validation site, of which 364 (4.3%) and 358 (5.9%) developed septic shock at least 4 hours after ED triage. The ML algorithm demonstrated an excellent area under the receiver operator curve (AUCroc) (>0.8) at 8 and 12 hours after initial ED triage for identification of patients who developed delayed septic shock at the development site. The use of transfer learning improved the ability to predict delayed septic shock by 12 hours from an AUCroc of 0.778 (sensitivity 0.85, specificity 0.549) to an AUCroc of 0.850 (sensitivity 0.85, specificity 0.678). We found similar results using the definition of sepsis provided by the most recent international guidelines for the diagnosis of sepsis. Conclusion(s): Approximately 5% of patients in the ED with severe sepsis progressed to septic shock at least 4 hours after initial triage. Our ML algorithm had an excellent AUCroc (>0.8) up to 12 hours for the detection of delayed septic shock up to 12 hours in advance at the development site. The use of transfer learning was able to improve the test characteristics of the algorithm at a second clinical site.Copyright Â© 2020",2020,,Annals of Emergency Medicine,76,4 Supplement,S116,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2020.09.316,,#3665,Wardi 2020,Exclusion reason: Lacks detail for definite inclusion; ,""
Prediction of sepsis-induced worsening of hemodynamics 6 hours in advance through machine learning,"Angelotti, G.; Falini, S.; Greco, M.; Cecconi, M.; Morandini, P.; Barbieri, R.; Chiti, A.","INTRODUCTION. Hemodynamic status of critically ill patients typically declines during sepsis and requires vasopressor support. Machine learning models have been recently implemented for a variety of ICU tasks with considerable success. A model capable of forecasting hemodynamic changes of septic patients could be critical in stratifying clinical intervention. Along this rationale, we hypothesize that the most predictive features would be those related to heart rate and blood pressure measurements, i.e. systolic (SP), diastolic (DP), mean (MP), or pulse pressure (PP). OBJECTIVES. The purpose of the analysis was to create a prediction model for worsening of hemodynamic status in septic patients by using data from the first 6 hours after ICU admission. METHODS. Data was pooled from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III)(1) database. Patients in the 18-89 age range fulfilling the international consensus sepsis-3 criteria(2,3) were included. An increment of vasopressor equivalents (VPE) above 0.2 mcg/kg/min over the following 6 hours was chosen as indication of worsening of hemodynamic status. Firstly, a ?null? logistic regression model using clinical data relative to the first 6 hours of ICU stay was trained to formulate predictions. Secondly, SP, DP, MP and PP were each integrated in the model and assessed for performance. Finally, a model with all pressure measurements was built and a feature selection process (LASSO) was run to yield only the most indicative. Performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), recall and F1 score. RESULTS. 5778 ICU stays were evaluated, of which 4370 (76%) do not receive vasopressors in the first 6 hours. The described increment in VPE was observed in 402 (6.9%) patients. Despite thelow prevalence, the models achieved moderate performance. The addition of any pressure measurement only slightly improved the AUC of the null model (0.84 vs 0.82) while it did improve recall, especially when using MP (0.83 vs 0.75). In all models, Glasgow coma scale and peripheral oxygen saturation were the the highest graded features; SP was also particularly highly ranked in its model, and MP and PP in an intermediate fashion. Likewise, the LASSO model selected SP as the most predictive feature. CONCLUSION. Increment of vasopressor dose, as a marker of worsening of hemodynamic status, could be predicted 6 hours in advance using clinical data with moderate accuracy. SP was revealed as the most predictive of all pressure measurements, although it did not markedly improve accuracy of the model itself.

Mathematical modeling of community-acquired pneumonia patients,"Sarkar, J.; Marathe, D. D.; Inglis, A. M.; Hurst, K. W.; Chang, S.; Kellum, J. A.; Angus, D. C.; Vodovotz, Y.","Introduction Sepsis is defined by the systemic response to an infection, governed by dynamic interactions between the tissues, immune cells and inflammatory mediators. We used the Immunetrics platform to build a large-scale mathematical model that encompasses these biological components. The model incorporates a virtual clinician, an automated system to examine simulated patients' status at clinically relevant intervals and administer standard of care interventions as necessary, thereby altering the dynamics of the disease state. The model reproduces many characteristics of systemic response to an infection, including the time course of cytokines, coagulation factors, clinical markers, early and late organ failure, and early versus late deaths. Methods The ordinary differential equation-based model was used to simulate the progression of sepsis over a 30-day hospital stay. This model was fit to published human endotoxemia data as well as data from severely septic community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients from the GenIMS study. The model was fit to 15 biomarkers and clinical markers, including mean arterial pressure, PaO2, creatinine, TNFalpha, IL-6, and PAI-1. Results Figure 1 illustrates simulated output as compared with the median time course data for surviving CAP patients without comorbidities and for CAP patients without co-morbidities who died between 4 and 8 days after admission. After incorporating changes in physiological and immune function due to patient demographics and co-morbidities (for example, COPD, cardiovascular disease), a handful of parameters were changed to fit the model to median time course data from 14 subgroups. These parameters included pathogen virulence, effectiveness of antibiotics, baseline status of patients at study inclusion, and occurrence of secondary infection. By overlaying variations in the above parameters about the median model, the model can encompass the entire spectrum of patients observed in the GenIMS study. The virtual clinician administers individualized treatment for each simulated patient. The model simulations provide clear evidence of changes in disease progression as a function of differences in treatment. Conclusions The ability of our model to reproduce a large variety of patients with a relatively small number of parameter changes illustrates the robustness of the underlying biological processes being modeled. The model may help identify real signals in immensely variable and noisy multidimensional sepsis patient data, and distinguish real patient responses from clinical study-siterelated variability. This model is currently undergoing further validation. Future capabilities include assessment of risk and benefit of new drugs for sepsis or new treatment strategies (for example, early goal-directed therapy) in different patient cohorts.",2009,,Critical Care,13,SUPPL. 4,S23,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/cc8105,,#1288,Sarkar 2009,"Exclusion reason: Non-routinely-collected data; Matthieu Komorowski (2021-12-11 00:34:18)(Select): simulation, non-routine data (cytolkines); ",""

While research communities have focused on creating state-of-the-art models, there has been less focus on real world implementation and the associated challenges to accuracy, fairness, accountability, and transparency that come from actual, situated use. Serious questions remain under examined regarding how to ethically build models, interpret and explain model output, recognize and account for biases, and minimize disruptions to professional expertise and work cultures. We address this gap in the literature and provide a detailed case study covering the development, implementation, and evaluation of Sepsis Watch, a machine learning-driven tool that assists hospital clinicians in the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. We, the team that developed and evaluated the tool, discuss our conceptualization of the tool not as a model deployed in the world but instead as a socio-technical system requiring integration into existing social and professional contexts. Rather than focusing on model interpretability to ensure a fair and accountable machine learning, we point toward four key values and practices that should be considered when developing machine learning to support clinical decision-making: rigorously define the problem in context, build relationships with stakeholders, respect professional discretion, and create ongoing feedback loops with stakeholders. Our work has significant implications for future research regarding mechanisms of institutional accountability and considerations for designing machine learning systems. Our work underscores the limits of model interpretability as a solution to ensure transparency, accuracy, and accountability in practice.

Methods Two hundred and ten elderly patients with sepsis admitted to the General Hospital of Eastern Theater Command of PLA from January 2018 to December 2019 were included. The highest Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score and sequential organ failure (SOFA) score were calculated during sepsis. According to clinical outcome, 210 patients were divided into septic shock (n=93) /non-shock (n=117) groups; severe (n=79)/mild organ dysfunction (n=131) groups and death (n=60)/survival groups (n=150). The differences in age, sex, smoking and drinking history, medical history, APACHE II score, SOFA score, RDW were compared between the different groups. Spearman's correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between RDW and APACHE II score, SOFA score, total hospital days and ICU hospital days. Unconditional logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors for septic shock, severe organ dysfunction and death in elderly patients with sepsis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were adopted to analyze the predictive value of RDW, SOFA score, and APACHE II score for septic shock and severe organ dysfunction in elderly patients with sepsis. Results The RDW, APACHE II score, SOFA score, the incidence of severe organ dysfunction and death in the septic shock group were higher than those of the non-sepsis group; RDW, APACHE IIscore, SOFA score, the incidences of septic shock and mortality in the severe organ dysfunction group were higher than those in the mild organ dysfunction group; RDW, APACHE II score, SOFA score, the incidence of septic shock and severe organ dysfunction in the death group were higher than those in the survival group, there was a significant difference between each group (P<0.05); RDW was positively correlated with APACHE II score, SOFA score, total hospital days and ICU hospital days (P<0.001); Elevated RDW was an independent risk factor for septic shock and severe organ dysfunction (P<0.05); the risk of septic shock and severe organ dysfunction was significantly increased when RDW>20% (P<0.05); The ROC AUC of SOFA score was 0.958, sensitivity was 0.817, specificity was 0.940, ROC AUC of RDW combined with SOFA score was 0.959, sensitivity was 0.968, specificity was 0.676 in predicting septic shock; The ROC AUC of APACHE II score was 0.973, sensitivity was 0.911, specificity was 0.931, the ROC AUC of the RDW combined with APACHE II score was 0.978, sensitivity was 0.972, and specificity was 0.668 in predicting severe organ dysfunction. Conclusions RDW is an independent risk factor to predict septic shock and severe organ dysfunction in elderly patients with sepsis; RDW combined with SOFA score and RDW combined with APACHE II score have better sensitivity to predict septic shock and severe organ dysfunction than any single factor.Copyright Â© 2021 People's Military Medical Press.

L.; Zhong, N. S.","Objective: To investigate the effects of sepsis bundles in China. Method: An observational study of 43 patients with severe pneumonia and septic shock admitted to the respiratory intensive care unit (1/11/ 2006-31/12/2007) was carried out. The selection criteria were in accordance with criteria set by International Conference On Sepsis in 2001. Implementation of 6 hours and 24 hours sepsis bundles was divided into 3 continuous phases consisting of education, trial, and application phase. A cohort of 43 patients with matched disease history (1/1/2004-31/ 10/2006) was enrolled as control group. The percentages for categorical variables and mean Â± SD for continuous variables were reported. Chi-Square test, unpaired Student's t-test, paired-samples t test, univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used. Statistical significance was defined as P <0.05. Results: There were very little significant differences in basic characteristics of patients between the two groups. Compared with control group, the differences in serum lactate, fluid resuscitation and fluid volume infused within 6 hours and blood glucose control in shock subgroup were significant (P values were 0.024, 0.009, 0.045, and 0.000, respectively). Compared with control group, the differences in respiratory rate and oxygenation index of bundles group at 72 hours later were significant (P values were 0.033 and 0.041, respectively). Compared with control group, the differences in APACHE II score and predicted mortality in shock subgroup of bundles were significant (P values were 0.017 and 0.040, respectively). Compared with control group, the reduction in absolute mortality was 23.30% in bundles group (P = 0.019).

A.; Bondarenko, I. B.","AIM: In a retrospective study, we evaluated factors associated with the early development of septic shock in patients with severe COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected medical records of the intensive care unit patients submitted by the local COVID-19 hospitals across Russia to the Federal Center for the Critical Care at the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (Sechenov University). Septic shock in crticially ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation was defined as a need in vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. RESULT(S): We studied 1078 patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care units for respiratory support. There were 611 males and 467 females. The mean age was 61.013.7 years. Five hundred twenty five medical records (48.7%) were received from the Moscow hospitals, 159 (14.7%) from the Moscow region, and 394 (36.5%) from the hospitals located in 58 regions of the Russian Federation. In 613 (56.9%) patients, diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by PCR, and in the other cases it was established on the basis of the clinical picture and the results of the chest CT scan. Septic shock developed in 214 (19.9%) of 1078 patients. In the logistic regression model, the risk of septic shock in patients older than 50 years was higher than in patients of a younger age (OR 2.34; 95% CI 1.533.67; p0.0001). In patients with more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was an increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes and malignant tumors. The risk of septic shock in patients with three or more concomitant diseases was higher than in patients without any concomitant chronic diseases (OR 1.76; 95% CI 1.762.70). CONCLUSION(S): The risk of septic shock in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by SARS-CoV-2 is higher in patients older than 50 years with concomitant diseases, although a severe course of the disease is also possible in younger patients without any concomitant disorders.",2020,,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,92,11,17-23,,http://dx.doi.org/10.26442/00403660.2020.11.000780,,#3435,Glybochko 2020,Exclusion reason: Not English or French; Myura Nagendran (2022-01-18 02:01:23)(Select): full text is russian; ,""
Effect of resuscitation strategy based on the early goal directed therapy on the prognosis of patients with shock,"Zhang, Yan-Fang; Li, Qiong-Fen; Chen, Lei; Wang, Yi; Wei, Hui-Ming; Qian, Chuan-Yun","Objective: To evaluate the effects of fluid management strategies in early goal directed therapy (EGDT) on the prognosis of patients with shock. Method(s): Clinical data of 79 patients with septic shock or hemorrhagic shock admitted to emergency intensive care unit (EICU) of the First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into continual fluid administrating group (n=41) in accordance with protocol calculating approximating fluid volume and adjust the infusion speed based on blood pressure, heart rate, pulse saturation of blood oxygen (SpO2) and urine output with the end of fluid resuscitation was set to restore spontaneous circulation function and wean off vasoactive drugs, and the conservative fluid resuscitation group (n=38) by means of using vasoactive agents to maintenance blood pressure after infusing amount (20 ml/kg) of liquid early, respectively. The 28-day mortality and the time of using pressure agents were compared between two groups. According to the 28-day mortality, patients were further divided into the survival group (n=37) and death group (n=42), and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score was compared between two groups. Logistic regression analysis of prognostic factors was conducted to identify and describe the relationship between the prognosis and fluid resuscitation methods and strategies. Result(s): The 28-day mortality of continual fluid administrating group was significantly lower than that of the conservative fluid resuscitation group (14.63% vs. 94.74%, P<0.01), total drugs supporting time (hours) was significantly shorter than that in conservative fluid resuscitation group (33.24 +/- 17.56 vs. 58.29 +/- 34.78, P<0.05). Thirty-six cases of 42 death patients received conservative fluid resuscitation (85.7%), but 35 cases of 37 survival patients received continual fluid administration (94.6%). Logistic regression analysis showed that odds ratio (OR) of brain natriuretic peptide before death or shifted out ICU was 0.9136, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.8125 to 0.9986, regression coefficient was -0.0931, P=0.0478, OR of procalcitonin before death or shifted out ICU was 0.9095, 95% CI was 0.8294 to 0.9973, regression coefficient was -0.0949, P=0.0436, and OR of blood lactate level before death or shifted out ICU was 0.5023, 95%CI was 0.2833 to 0.8905, regression coefficient was -0.6885, P=0.0184.

"Derivation, Validation, and Potential Treatment Implications of Novel Clinical Phenotypes for Sepsis","Yealy, Donald M.; Seymour, Christopher W.; Kennedy, Jason N.; Clermont, Gilles; Gomez, Hernando; Huang, David T.; Kellum, John A.; Wang, Shu; Xu, Zhongying; Talisa, Victor; Chang, Chung-Chou H.; Angus, Derek C.; Elliott, Corrine F.; Berry, Scott; Cooper, Gregory; Visweswaran, Shyam; Mi, Qi; Opal, Steven M.; Van Der Poll, Tom; Vodovotz, Yoram; Weiss, Jeremy C.; Yende, Sachin","Importance: Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome. Identification of distinct clinical phenotypes may allow more precise therapy and improve care. Objective(s): To derive sepsis phenotypes from clinical data, determine their reproducibility and correlation with host-response biomarkers and clinical outcomes, and assess the potential causal relationship with results from randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Design, Settings, and Participants: Retrospective analysis of data sets using statistical, machine learning, and simulation tools. Phenotypes were derived among 20189 total patients (16552 unique patients) who met Sepsis-3 criteria within 6 hours of hospital presentation at 12 Pennsylvania hospitals (2010-2012) using consensus k means clustering applied to 29 variables. Reproducibility and correlation with biological parameters and clinical outcomes were assessed in a second database (2013-2014; n = 43086 total patients and n = 31160 unique patients), in a prospective cohort study of sepsis due to pneumonia (n = 583), and in 3 sepsis RCTs (n = 4737). Exposures: All clinical and laboratory variables in the electronic health record. Main Outcomes and Measures: Derived phenotype (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) frequency, host-response biomarkers, 28-day and 365-day mortality, and RCT simulation outputs. Result(s): The derivation cohort included 20189 patients with sepsis (mean age, 64 [SD, 17] years; 10022 [50%] male; mean maximum 24-hour Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score, 3.9 [SD, 2.4]). The validation cohort included 43086 patients (mean age, 67 [SD, 17] years; 21993 [51%] male; mean maximum 24-hour SOFA score, 3.6 [SD, 2.0]). Of the 4 derived phenotypes, the alpha phenotype was the most common (n = 6625; 33%) and included patients with the lowest administration of a vasopressor; in the beta phenotype (n = 5512; 27%), patients were older and had more chronic illness and renal dysfunction; in the gamma phenotype (n = 5385; 27%), patients had more inflammation and pulmonary dysfunction; and in the delta phenotype (n = 2667; 13%), patients had more liver dysfunction and septic shock. Phenotype distributions were similar in the validation cohort. There were consistent differences in biomarker patterns by phenotype. In the derivation cohort, cumulative 28-day mortality was 287 deaths of 5691 unique patients (5%) for the alpha phenotype; 561 of 4420 (13%) for the beta phenotype; 1031 of 4318 (24%) for the gamma phenotype; and 897 of 2223 (40%) for the delta phenotype. Across all cohorts and trials, 28-day and 365-day mortality were highest among the delta phenotype vs the other 3 phenotypes (P <.001). In simulation models, the proportion of RCTs reporting benefit, harm, or no effect changed considerably (eg, varying the phenotype frequencies within an RCT of early goal-directed therapy changed the results from >33% chance of benefit to >60% chance of harm). Conclusions and Relevance: In this retrospective analysis of data sets from patients with sepsis, 4 clinical phenotypes were identified that correlated with host-response patterns and clinical outcomes, and simulations suggested these phenotypes may help in understanding heterogeneity of treatment effects. Further research is needed to determine the utility of these phenotypes in clinical care and for informing trial design and interpretation.Copyright Â© 2019 American Medical Association.
