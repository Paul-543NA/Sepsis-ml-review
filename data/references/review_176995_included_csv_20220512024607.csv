"Multicenter validation of a sepsis prediction algorithm using only vital sign data in the emergency department, general ward and ICU","Mao, Q.; Jay, M.; Hoffman, J.; Calvert, J.; Barton, C.; Shimabukuro, D.; Shieh, L.; Chettipally, U.; Fletcher, G.; Kerem, Y.; Zhou, Y.; Das, R.","ObjectivesWe validate a machine learning-based sepsis prediction algorithm (InSight) for detection and prediction of three sepsis-related gold standards, using only six vital signs. We evaluate robustness to missing data, customization to site-specific data using transfer learning, and generalizability to new settings.\n\nDesignA machine learning algorithm with gradient tree boosting. Features for prediction were created from combinations of only six vital sign measurements and their changes over time.\n\nSettingA mixed-ward retrospective data set from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Medical Center (San Francisco, CA) as the primary source, an intensive care unit data set from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA) as a transfer learning source, and four additional institutions datasets to evaluate generalizability.\n\nParticipants684,443 total encounters, with 90,353 encounters from June 2011 to March 2016 at UCSF.\n\nInterventionsnone\n\nPrimary and secondary outcome measuresArea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for detection and prediction of sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock.\n\nResultsFor detection of sepsis and severe sepsis, InSight achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.92 (95% CI 0.90 - 0.93) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.86 - 0.88), respectively. Four hours before onset, InSight predicts septic shock with an AUROC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.94 -0.98), and severe sepsis with an AUROC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.79 - 0.91).\n\nConclusionsInSight outperforms existing sepsis scoring systems in identifying and predicting sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock.

Deep Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Sepsis Treatment,"Yu, Chao; Ren, Guoqi; Liu, Jiming","Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in hospitals, but its optimal treatment strategy still remains unclear. Recent years have witnessed several successful applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches in sepsis treatment, achieving far more efficient strategies than those by clinicians. To ensure such applications, an explicit reward function encoding medical domain knowledge should be specified beforehand to indicate the goal of learning. However, due to the paucity of clear understanding of sepsis itself, there is still considerable inconsistency in the formulation of reward functions for sepsis treatment. In this poster, we address the reward learning problem in RL for treatment of sepsis, which has been largely neglected by previous studies. A deep inverse RL with Mini-Tree (DIRL-MT) model is proposed to infer the best reward functions from a set of presumably optimal treatment trajectories using retrospective real medical data. In the model, the MT component learns the factors that are most important in influencing the mortality during sepsis treatment, while the DIRL component infers the complete reward function in terms of weights of those factors. Our work shows that PaO2 and PT can play a vital role and should be paid more attention in the design of more efficient treatment strategies for sepsis in the future.",2019,2019/june,2019 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI),,,1–3-1–3,,,,#6165,Yu 2019,"",""
Optimal sepsis patient treatment using human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence,"Gupta, A.; Lash, M. T.; Nachimuthu, S. K.","Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death in Intensive Care Units (ICU). The strategy for treating sepsis involves the infusion of intravenous (IV) fluids and administration of antibiotics. Determining the optimal quantity of IV fluids is a challenging problem due to the complexity of a patient's physiology. In this study, we develop a data-driven optimization solution that derives the optimal quantity of IV fluids for individual patients. The proposed method minimizes the probability of severe outcomes by controlling the prescribed quantity of IV fluids and utilizes human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence. We demonstrate the performance of our model on 1122 ICU patients with sepsis diagnosis extracted from the MIMIC-III dataset. The results show that, on average, our model can reduce mortality by 22%.

Multimodal Early Septic Shock Prediction Model using Lasso Regression with Decaying Response,"Hammoud, I.; Ramakrishnan, I. V.; Henry, M.; Morley, E.","Sepsis is one of the leading causes of in-hospital deaths. In this paper, we propose a multimodal early prediction system for septic shock, which is a serious complication for patients with sepsis. Our system utilizes patients vital and laboratory time series data in combination with medical notes to predict patients at risk of septic shock in real-Time. Our model achieves 0.89 ROC AUC and a median detection time of 30.64 hours before the onset of the septic shock event at a specificity of 0.67. Our proposed method uses lasso regression with modified response decay to model the risk as we go further away in time from the septic shock event. We compare the performance of our model to baseline and state-of-The-Art models used to predict early deterioration and septic shock in ICU patients. Our model shows improvement in both ROC AUC and median detection time at all specificities. This translates into an earlier prediction time at a higher true positive rate for the same false positive rate. Moreover, we investigate the ROC AUC and median detection time trade-off and propose an automated way for model selection under such trade-off. We also demonstrate how the model selection step could also be modified to optimize for a predefined user utility. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,,"8th IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics, ICHI 2020",,,,,10.1109/ICHI48887.2020.9374377,,#5834,Hammoud 2020,"",""
Septic Shock Prediction for Patients with Missing Data,"Ho, Joyce C.; Lee, Cheng H.; Ghosh, Joydeep","Sepsis and septic shock are common and potentially fatal conditions that often occur in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Early prediction of patients at risk for septic shock is therefore crucial to minimizing the effects of these complications. Potential indications for septic shock risk span a wide range of measurements, including physiological data gathered at different temporal resolutions and gene expression levels, leading to a nontrivial prediction problem. Previous works on septic shock prediction have used small, carefully curated datasets or clinical measurements that may not be available for many ICU patients. The recent availability of a large, rich ICU dataset called MIMIC-II has provided the opportunity for more extensive modeling of this problem. However, such a large clinical dataset inevitably contains a substantial amount of missing data. We investigate how different imputation selection criteria and methods can overcome the missing data problem. Our results show that imputation methods in conjunction with predictive modeling can lead to accurate septic shock prediction, even if the features are restricted primarily to noninvasive measurements. Our models provide a generalized approach for predicting septic shock in any ICU patient.",2014,,ACM Trans. Manage. Inf. Syst.,5,1,1–15-1–15,,,,#6139,Ho 2014,"",""
Clustering Blood Pressure Trajectories in Septic Shock in the Emergency Department,"Prasad, Varesh; Lynch, James C.; Filbin, Michael R.; Reisner, Andrew T.; Heldt, Thomas","Hemodynamic management of sepsis in the emergency department relies on fluid resuscitation and vasoactive therapy to maintain adequate blood pressure and end-organ perfusion. While typical practice targets certain thresholds of blood pressure (such as 65 mmHg mean arterial or 90 mmHg systolic blood pressure [SBP]), little consideration is given to temporal dynamics of blood pressure. In this work, we use unsupervised learning methods to reveal characteristic SBP trajectories in the two hours either surrounding the start of hypotensive episodes (SBP <; 90 mmHg) or immediately preceding the initiation of vasopressor therapy. Our results show that hypotensive episodes tended to either resolve very quickly (within 40 minutes) or extend for prolonged periods (at least 1 hour). Those with prolonged hypotension constituted 74% of all patients with at least one measurement of SBP <; 90 mmHg. Of them, patients who entered hypotension by a large, acute drop from a normal SBP over the preceding hour had a greater incidence of subsequent vasopressor administration than those with a more gradual decline into hypotension. Overall, our results suggest that a significant subset of patients, especially those with stable but low SBP, should have received vasopressors when they did not, or should have received them sooner. Dynamic trajectories appear to be important factors in clinical practice of hemodynamic management of sepsis.",2019,,Conference proceedings : ...

Predicting Volume Responsiveness Among Sepsis Patients Using Clinical Data and Continuous Physiological Waveforms,"Kamaleswaran, Rishikesan; Lian, Jiaoying; Lin, Dong-Lien; Molakapuri, Himasagar; Nunna, SriManikanth; Shah, Parth; Padman, Rema; Dua, Shiv","The efficacy of early fluid treatment in patients with sepsis is unclear and may contribute to serious adverse events due to fluid non-responsiveness. The current method of deciding if patients are responsive to fluid administration is often subjective and requires manual intervention. This study utilizes MIMIC III and associated matched waveform datasets across the entire ICU stay duration of each patient to develop prediction models for assessing fluid responsiveness in sepsis patients. We developed a pipeline to extract high frequency continuous waveform data and included waveform features in the prediction models. Comparing across five machine learning models, random forest performed the best when no waveform information is added (AUC = 0.84), with mean arterial blood pressure and age identified as key factors. After incorporation of features from physiologic waveforms, logistic regression with L1 penalty provided consistent performance and high interpretability, achieving an accuracy of 0.89 and F1 score of 0.90.Copyright ©2020 AMIA - All rights reserved.",2020,,AMIA ...

Spectral clustering of risk score trajectories stratifies sepsis patients by clinical outcome and interventions received,"Greenstein, Joseph L.; Liu, Ran; Winslow, Raimond L.; Fackler, James C.; Bembea, Melania M.","Sepsis is not a monolithic disease, but a loose collection of symptoms with diverse outcomes. Thus, stratification and subtyping of sepsis patients is of great importance. We examine the temporal evolution of patient state using our previously-published method for computing risk of transition from sepsis into septic shock. Risk trajectories diverge into four clusters following early prediction of septic shock, stratifying by outcome: the highest-risk and lowest-risk groups have a 76.5% and 10.4% prevalence of septic shock, and 43% and 18% mortality, respectively. These clusters differ also in treatments received and median time to shock onset. Analyses reveal the existence of a rapid (30-60 min) transition in risk at the time of threshold crossing. We hypothesize that this transition occurs as a result of the failure of compensatory biological systems to cope with infection, resulting in a bifurcation of low to high risk. Such a collapse, we believe, represents the true onset of septic shock. Thus, this rapid elevation in risk represents a potential new data-driven definition of septic shock.Copyright © Liu et al.",2020,,Elife,9,,1-17,,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/ELIFE.58142,,#3442,Greenstein 2020,Zuzanna Bien (2022-02-08 01:27:42)(Select): sepsis shock prediction based on cluster membership - ?think it can be included; ,""
Early diagnosis and prediction of sepsis shock by combining static and dynamic information using convolutional-LSTM,"Lin, C.; Zhangy, Y.; Ivy, J.; Capan, M.; Arnold, R.; Huddleston, J. M.; Chi, M.","Deep neural network models, especially Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), have shown great success in analyzing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies in time series data. In this paper, we proposed a general deep neural network framework which incorporates two additional components with the aim of improving LSTM. The first component, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is added before LSTM to obtain local characteristics of EHRs. The second component, a fully connected neural network (FC), introduces static information (e.g., age) to LSTM, which is applied to handle dynamic information (e.g., lab result). The medical condition we aim to predict is septic shock - it is the most advanced complication of sepsis and is due to severe abnormalities in circulation and/or cellular metabolism. Our proposed framework was evaluated for two experimental tasks: visit level early diagnosis (left align) and event level early prediction (right align). Our results show that for visit level early diagnosis, by incorporating both CNN and static information, our framework consistently outperforms the original LSTM. For event level early prediction, the same outcome is observed when predicting < 5 hours into the future, however, when predicting ≥ 5 hours into the future, the addition of the CNN component alone obtains the best results. © 2018 IEEE.",2018,,"6th IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics, ICHI 2018",,,219-228,,10.1109/ICHI.2018.00032,,#5629,Lin 2018,Zuzanna Bien (2022-02-14 21:02:47)(Select): both visit-level and early prediction (2-24h) ; ,""

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort for algorithm derivation and validation, pre-post impact evaluation. SETTING: Tertiary teaching hospital system in Philadelphia, PA. PATIENTS: All non-ICU admissions; algorithm derivation July 2011 to June 2014 (n = 162,212); algorithm validation October to December 2015 (n = 10,448); silent versus alert comparison January 2016 to February 2017 (silent n = 22,280; alert n = 32,184). INTERVENTIONS: A random-forest classifier, derived and validated using electronic health record data, was deployed both silently and later with an alert to notify clinical teams of sepsis prediction. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULT: Patients identified for training the algorithm were required to have International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition codes for severe sepsis or septic shock and a positive blood culture during their hospital encounter with either a lactate greater than 2.2 mmol/L or a systolic blood pressure less than 90mm Hg. The algorithm demonstrated a sensitivity of 26% and specificity of 98%, with a positive predictive value of 29% and positive likelihood ratio of 13. The alert resulted in a small statistically significant increase in lactate testing and IV fluid administration. There was no significant difference in mortality, discharge disposition, or transfer to ICU, although there was a reduction in time-to-ICU transfer.

Multi-complexity measures of heart rate variability and the effect of vasopressor titration: A prospective cohort study of patients with septic shock,"Sorensen, Jeffrey; Brown, Samuel M.; Lanspa, Michael J.; Grissom, Colin K.; Rondina, Matthew T.; Shahul, Sajid; Mathews, V. J.","Background: Septic shock is a common and often devastating syndrome marked by severe cardiovascular dysfunction commonly managed with vasopressors. Whether markers of heart rate complexity before vasopressor up-titration could be used to predict success of the up-titration is not known. Method(s): We studied patients with septic shock requiring vasopressor, newly admitted to the intensive care unit. We measured the complexity of heart rate variability (using the ratio of fractal exponents from detrended fluctuation analysis) in the 5 min before all vasopressor up-titrations in the first 24 h of an intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A successful up-titration was defined as one that did not require further up-titration (or decrease in mean arterial pressure) for 60 min. Result(s): We studied 95 patients with septic shock, with a median APACHE II of 27 (IQR: 20-37). The median number of up-titrations, normalized to 24 h, was 12.2 (IQR: 8-17) with a maximum of 49. Of the up-titrations, the median proportion of successful interventions was 0.28 (IQR: 0.12-0.42). The median of mean arterial pressure (MAP) at the time of a vasopressor up-titration was 66 mmHg; the average infusion rate of norepinephrine at the time of an up-titration was 0.11 mcg/kg/min. The ratio of fractal exponents was not associated with successful up-titration on univariate or multivariate regression. On exploratory secondary analyses, however, the long-term fractal exponent was associated (p = 0.003) with success of up-titration. Independent of heart rate variability, MAP was associated (p < 0.001) with success of vasopressor up-titration, while neither Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) nor Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score was associated with vasopressor titration. Conclusion(s): Only a third of vasopressor up-titrations were successful among patients with septic shock. MAP and the long-term fractal exponent were associated with success of up-titration. These two, complementary variables may be important to the development of rational vasopressor titration protocols.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).",2016,,BMC Infectious Diseases,16,1,551,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-1896-1,,#2380,Sorensen 2016,"",""
Developing predictive models using electronic medical records: challenges and pitfalls,"Paxton, Chris; Saria, Suchi; Niculescu-Mizil, Alexandru","While Electronic Medical Records (EMR) contain detailed records of the patient-clinician encounter - vital signs, laboratory tests, symptoms, caregivers' notes, interventions prescribed and outcomes - developing predictive models from this data is not straightforward. These data contain systematic biases that violate assumptions made by off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms, commonly used in the literature to train predictive models. In this paper, we discuss key issues and subtle pitfalls specific to building predictive models from EMR. We highlight the importance of carefully considering both the special characteristics of EMR as well as the intended clinical use of the predictive model and show that failure to do so could lead to developing models that are less useful in practice.

Classification models to predict vasopressor administration for septic shock in the emergency department,"Prasad, Varesh; Lynch, James C.; Pasakarnis, Corey L.; Thorsen, Jill E.; Filbin, Michael R.; Reisner, Andrew T.; Heldt, Thomas","Optimal management of sepsis and septic shock in the emergency department (ED) involves timely decisions related to intravenous fluid resuscitation and initiation of vasoactive medication support. A decision-support tool trained on electronic health record data, can help improve this complex decision. We retrospectively extracted vital signs, lab measurements, and fluid administration information from 807 patient visits over a two-year period to a major ED. Patients selected for inclusion had a high likelihood of septic shock. We trained binary classifiers to discriminate between patients administered vasopressors in the ED and those not administered vasopressors at any point. Using features extracted from the entire ED visit record yielded a maximum area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.798 (95% CI 0.725-0.849) in a hold-out test set. In a separate task, we used individual vital signs observations with lab results to predict vasopressor administration, yielding a maximum AUC of 0.762 (95% CI 0.748-0.777). Lastly, we trained separate classifiers for different subgroups of vital signs observations. These subgroups were defined by the cumulative number of fluid boluses delivered at the time of the observation. The maximum AUC achieved by any of these classifiers was 0.815 (95% CI 0.784-0.853), occurring for vital signs observations made after 2 bolus administrations.

Individualized fluid administration for critically ill patients with sepsis with an interpretable dynamic treatment regimen model,"Zhang, Zhongheng; Zheng, Bin; Liu, Nan","Fluid strategy is the key to the successful management of patients with sepsis. However, previous studies failed to consider individualized treatment strategy, and clinical trials typically included patients with sepsis as a homogeneous study population. We aimed to develop sequential decision rules for managing fluid intake in patients with sepsis by using the dynamic treatment regimen (DTR) model. A retrospective analysis of the eICU Collaborative Research Database comprising highly granular data collected from 335 units at 208 hospitals was performed. The DTR model used a backward induction algorithm to estimate the sequence of optimal rules. 22,868 patients who had sepsis according to the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV diagnosis group were included. Optimal fluid management (liberal [>40 ml/kg/d] versus restricted [<40 ml/kg/d]) strategy were developed on the Day 1, 3 and 5 after ICU admission according to current states and treatment history. Important determinants of optimal fluid strategy included mean blood pressure, heart rate, previous urine output, previous fluid strategy, ICU type and mechanical ventilation. Different functional forms such as quadratic function and interaction terms were used at different stages. The proportion of subjects being inappropriately treated with liberal fluid strategy (i.e. those actually received liberal fluid strategy, but could have longer survival time if they received restricted fluid strategy) increased from day 1 to 5 (19.3% to 29.5%). The survival time could be significantly prolonged had all patients been treated with optimal fluid strategy (5.7 [2.0, 5.9] vs. 4.1 [2.0, 5.0] days; p<0.001). With a large volume of sepsis data, we successfully computed out a sequence of dynamic fluid management strategy for sepsis patients over the first 5 days after ICU admission.

LiSep LSTM: A Machine Learning Algorithm for Early Detection of Septic Shock,"Fagerstrom, Josef; Bang, Magnus; Chew, Michelle S.; Wilhelms, Daniel","Sepsis is a major health concern with global estimates of 31.5 million cases per year. Case fatality rates are still unacceptably high, and early detection and treatment is vital since it significantly reduces mortality rates for this condition.

Reduced Rank Least Squares for Real-Time Short Term Estimation of Mean Arterial Blood Pressure in Septic Patients Receiving Norepinephrine,"Tang, Yi; Brown, Samuel; Sorensen, Jeff; Harley, Joel B.","Norepinephrine (NE), an endogenous catecholamine, is a mainstay treatment for septic shock, which is a life-threatening manifestation of severe infection. NE counteracts the loss in blood pressure associated with septic shock. However, an NE infusion that is too low fails to counteract the blood pressure drop, and an NE infusion that is too high can cause a hypertensive crisis and heart attack. Ideally, the NE infusion rate should maintain a patient's mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. There are a few data-driven, quantitative models to predict the MAP, and incorporate NE effects. This paper presents a model, driven by intensive care unit (ICU) measurable data and known NE inputs, to predict the future MAP of an ICU patient. We derive a least square estimation model for MAP based on available ICU data, including heart period, NE infusion rate, and respiration wave. We learn the parameters of our model from initial patient data and then use this information to predict future MAP data. We assess our model with data from 12 septic patients. Our model successfully predicts and tracks MAP when the NE infusion rate changes. Specifically, we predict MAP 3 to 20 min in the future with the mean error of less than 4 to 7 mmHg over 12 patients. Conclusion(s): this new approach creates the potential to advance methods for predicting NE infusion rate in septic patients.

The mixed fuzzy clustering (MFC) algorithm is used for determining the parameters of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models (FMs) in two different ways: (1) MFC FM, where the antecedent fuzzy sets are determined based on the partition matrix generated by the mixed fuzzy clustering algorithm; (2) FCM–UMFC FM, where the input features are transformed using MFC and the antecedent fuzzy sets are derived using fuzzy c-means (FCM). The fuzzy modeling approaches are tested on four health care applications for the classification of critically ill patients: administration of vasopressors in pancreatitis and pneumonia patients, mortality in septic shock and early readmissions.

Class-Modeling of Septic Shock With Hyperdimensional Computing,"Watkinson, N. D.; Givargis, T.; Joe, V.; Nicolau, A.; Veidenbaum, A.","Sepsis arises when a patients immune system has an extreme reaction to an infection. This is followed by septic shock if damage to organ tissue is so extensive that it causes a total systemic failure. Early detection of septic shock among septic patients could save critical time for preparation and prevention treatment. Due to the high variance in symptoms and patient state before shock, it is challenging to create a protocol that would be effective across patients. However, since septic shock is an acute change in patient state, modeling patient stability could be more effective in detecting a condition that departs from it. In this paper we present a one-class classification approach to septic shock using hyperdimensional computing. We built various models that consider different contexts and can be adapted according to a target priority. Among septic patients, the models can detect septic shock accurately with 90% sensitivity and overall accuracy of 60% of the cases up to three hours before the onset of septic shock, with the ability to adjust predictions according to incoming data. Additionally, the models can be easily adapted to prioritize sensitivity (increase true positives) or specificity (decrease false positives).",2021,,,,,,,,,#6130,Watkinson 2021,Finneas Catling (2022-04-27 02:42:25)(Included): Very poorly written paper (maybe an undergrad assignment?) but I can't find a reason to exclude it.

Trading-Off Cost of Deployment Versus Accuracy in Learning Predictive Models,"Robinson, Daniel P.; Saria, Suchi","Predictive models are finding an increasing number of applications in many industries. As a result, a practical means for trading-off the cost of deploying a model versus its effectiveness is needed. Our work is motivated by risk prediction problems in healthcare. Cost-structures in domains such as healthcare are quite complex, posing a significant challenge to existing approaches. We propose a novel framework for designing cost-sensitive structured regularizers that is suitable for problems with complex cost dependencies. We draw upon a surprising connection to boolean circuits. In particular, we represent the problem costs as a multi-layer boolean circuit, and then use properties of boolean circuits to define an extended feature vector and a group regularizer that exactly captures the underlying cost structure. The resulting regularizer may then be combined with a fidelity function to perform model prediction, for example. For the challenging real-world application of risk prediction for sepsis in intensive care units, the use of our regularizer leads to models that are in harmony with the underlying cost structure and thus provide an excellent prediction accuracy versus cost tradeoff.",2016,,,,,,,,,#9,Robinson 2016,"",""

The study aimed to identify subclasses of septic shock with non-supervised learning algorithms, so as to tailor resuscitation strategy for each class. Method(s): Patients with septic shock in 25 tertiary care teaching hospitals in China from January 2016 to December 2017 were enrolled in the study. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected on days 0, 1, 2, 3 and 7 after ICU admission. Subclasses of septic shock were identified by both finite mixture modeling and K-means clustering. Individualized fluid volume and norepinephrine dose were estimated using dynamic treatment regime (DTR) model to optimize the final mortality outcome. DTR models were validated in the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) dataset. Result(s): A total of 1437 patients with a mortality rate of 29% were included for analysis. The finite mixture modeling and K-means clustering robustly identified five classes of septic shock. Class 1 (baseline class) accounted for the majority of patients over all days; class 2 (critical class) had the highest severity of illness; class 3 (renal dysfunction) was characterized by renal dysfunction; class 4 (respiratory failure class) was characterized by respiratory failure; and class 5 (mild class) was characterized by the lowest mortality rate (21%). The optimal fluid infusion followed the resuscitation/de-resuscitation phases with initial large volume infusion and late restricted volume infusion. While class 1 transitioned to de-resuscitation phase on day 3, class 3 transitioned on day 1. Classes 1 and 3 might benefit from early use of norepinephrine, and class 2 can benefit from delayed use of norepinephrine while waiting for adequate fluid infusion. Conclusion(s): Septic shock comprises a heterogeneous population that can be robustly classified into five phenotypes. These classes can be easily identified with routine clinical variables and can help to tailor resuscitation strategy in the context of precise medicine.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,,Critical Care,25,1,243,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13054-021-03682-7,,#3808,Ma 2021,"",""
The Actor Search Tree Critic (ASTC) for Off-Policy POMDP Learning in Medical Decision Making,"Li, Luchen; Komorowski, Matthieu; Faisal, Aldo A.","Off-policy reinforcement learning enables near-optimal policy from suboptimal experience, thereby provisions opportunity for artificial intelligence applications in healthcare. Previous works have mainly framed patient-clinician interactions as Markov decision processes, while true physiological states are not necessarily fully observable from clinical data. We capture this situation with partially observable Markov decision process, in which an agent optimises its actions in a belief represented as a distribution of patient states inferred from individual history trajectories. A Gaussian mixture model is fitted for the observed data. Moreover, we take into account the fact that nuance in pharmaceutical dosage could presumably result in significantly different effect by modelling a continuous policy through a Gaussian approximator directly in the policy space, i.e. the actor. To address the challenge of infinite number of possible belief states which renders exact value iteration intractable, we evaluate and plan for only every encountered belief, through heuristic search tree by tightly maintaining lower and upper bounds of the true value of belief. We further resort to function approximations to update value bounds estimation, i.e. the critic, so that the tree search can be improved through more compact bounds at the fringe nodes that will be back-propagated to the root. Both actor and critic parameters are learned via gradient-based approaches. Our proposed policy trained from real intensive care unit data is capable of dictating dosing on vasopressors and intravenous fluids for sepsis patients that lead to the best patient outcomes.",2018,,,,,,,,,#26,Li 2018,"",""
Safety-driven design of machine learning for sepsis treatment,"Jia, Yan; McDermid, John; Habli, Ibrahim; Lawton, Tom; Burden, John","Machine learning (ML) has the potential to bring significant clinical benefits. However, there are patient safety challenges in introducing ML in complex healthcare settings and in assuring the technology to the satisfaction of the different regulators. The work presented in this paper tackles the urgent problem of proactively assuring ML in its clinical context as a step towards enabling the safe introduction of ML into clinical practice. In particular, the paper considers the use of deep Reinforcement Learning, a type of ML, for sepsis treatment. The methodology starts with the modelling of a clinical workflow that integrates the ML model for sepsis treatment recommendations. Then safety analysis is carried out based on the clinical workflow, identifying hazards and safety requirements for the ML model. In this paper the design of the ML model is enhanced to satisfy the safety requirements for mitigating a major clinical hazard: sudden change of vasopressor dose. A rigorous evaluation is conducted to show how these requirements are met. A safety case is presented, providing a basis for regulators to make a judgement on the acceptability of introducing the ML model into sepsis treatment in a healthcare setting. The overall argument is broad in considering the wider patient safety considerations, but the detailed rationale and supporting evidence presented relate to this specific hazard. Whilst there are no agreed regulatory approaches to introducing ML into healthcare, the work presented in this paper has shown a possible direction for overcoming this barrier and exploit the benefits of ML without compromising safety.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,117,,103762,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103762,,#3775,Jia 2021,"",""

Method: This cross-sectional observational study included 37 critically ill patients with acute circulatory failure who required fluid challenge. The patients were sedated and mechanically ventilated with a VT of 6-7 ml/kg ideal body weight, which was monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter and an arterial line. The mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic parameters, including ΔRESPPP, were measured before and after fluid challenge with 1,000 ml crystalloids or 500 ml colloids. Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in the cardiac index of at least 15%. ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT01569308. Results: A total of 17 patients were classified as responders. Analysis of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) showed that the optimal cut-off point for ΔRESPPP to predict fluid responsiveness was 10% (AUC = 0.74). Adjustment of the ΔRESPPP to account for driving pressure did not improve the accuracy (AUC = 0.76).

Physiology-Informed Real-Time Mean Arterial Blood Pressure Learning and Prediction for Septic Patients Receiving Norepinephrine,"Tang, Yi; Brown, Samuel M.; Sorensen, Jeff; Harley, Joel B.","Objective: Septic shock is a life-threatening manifestation of infection with a mortality of 20-50% [1]. A catecholamine vasopressor, norepinephrine (NE), is widely used to treat septic shock primarily by increasing blood pressure. For this reason, future blood pressure knowledge is invaluable for properly controlling NE infusion rates in septic patients. However, recent machine learning and data-driven methods often treat the physiological effects of NE as a black box. In this paper, a real-time, physiology-informed human mean arterial blood pressure model for septic shock patients undergoing NE infusion is studied. Method(s): Our methods combine learning theory, adaptive filter theory, and physiology. We learn least mean square adaptive filters to predict three physiological parameters (heart rate, pulse pressure, and the product of total arterial compliance and arterial resistance) from previous data and previous NE infusion rate. These predictions are combined according to a physiology model to predict future mean arterial blood pressure. Result(s): Our model successfully forecasts mean arterial blood pressure on 30 septic patients from two databases. Specifically, we predict mean arterial blood pressure 3.33 minutes to 20 minutes into the future with a root mean square error from 3.56 mmHg to 6.22 mmHg. Additionally, we compare the computational cost of different models and discover a correlation between learned NE response models and a patient's SOFA score.

Here, we study a method of automating biomedical data science using a web-based AI platform to recommend model choices and conduct experiments. We have two goals in mind: first, to make it easy to construct sophisticated models of biomedical processes; and second, to provide a fully automated AI agent that can choose and conduct promising experiments for the user, based on the user's experiments as well as prior knowledge. To validate this framework, we conduct an experiment on 165 classification problems, comparing to state-of-the-art, automated approaches.

Given that estimation of optimal DTRs is often exploratory and communication with clinicians is vital, robust and flexible methods that yield interpretable results are needed. Tree-based methods utilizing a purity measure defined on the full set of covariates have enjoyed much success in meeting this goal. Often, however, it is necessary for clinical, practical, or ethical reasons to restrict certain covariates that should be used when making treatment decisions. Herein we present restricted sub-tree learning (ReST-L), a flexible and robust, sub-tree-based method to estimate an optimal multi-stage multi-treatment DTR that enables restrictions to the set of prespecified candidate tailoring variables. ReST-L employs a purity measure derived from an augmented inverse probability weighted estimator for the counterfactual mean outcome, using observational data to build multi-stage decision trees that are restricted in sub-tree spaces defined by the corresponding prescriptive covariates. We show that ReST-L is able to correctly estimate the optimal DTR searching over a large number of variables with relatively small sample sizes and improves upon competing estimation methods. We demonstrate the utility of ReST-L to estimate a two-stage fluid resuscitation strategy for patients admitted to an intensive care unit with acute emergent sepsis.Copyright © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2021,,Statistics in Medicine,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sim.9155,,#3877,Speth 2021,"",""
Natural Language Processing of Clinical Notes for Improved Early Prediction of Septic Shock in the ICU,"Liu, Ran; Greenstein, Joseph L.; Sarma, Sridevi V.; Winslow, Raimond L.","Sepsis and septic shock are major concerns in public health as the leading contributors to hospital mortality and cost of treatment in the United States. Early treatment is instrumental for improving patient outcome; to this end, algorithmic methods for early prediction of septic shock have been developed using electronic health record data, with the goal of decreasing treatment delay. We extend a previously-developed method, using a gradient boosting algorithm (XG-Boost) to compute a time-evolving risk of impending transition into septic shock, by combining physiological data from the electronic health record with features obtained from natural language processing of clinical note data. We compare two different methods for generating natural language processing features, with the best method obtaining improved performance of 0.92 AUC, 84% sensitivity, 82% specificity, 49% positive predictive value, and a median early warning time of 7.0 hours. This degree of early warning is sufficient to enable intervention many hours in advance of septic shock onset, with the improved prediction performance of this method resulting in fewer false alarms and thus more actionable predictions.",2019,,Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

An Empirical Study of Representation Learning for Reinforcement Learning in Healthcare,"Killian, Taylor W.; Zhang, Haoran; Subramanian, Jayakumar; Fatemi, Mehdi; Ghassemi, Marzyeh","Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently been applied to sequential estimation and prediction problems identifying and developing hypothetical treatment strategies for septic patients, with a particular focus on offline learning with observational data. In practice, successful RL relies on informative latent states derived from sequential observations to develop optimal treatment strategies. To date, how best to construct such states in a healthcare setting is an open question. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of several information encoding architectures using data from septic patients in the MIMIC-III dataset to form representations of a patient state. We evaluate the impact of representation dimension, correlations with established acuity scores, and the treatment policies derived from them. We find that sequentially formed state representations facilitate effective policy learning in batch settings, validating a more thoughtful approach to representation learning that remains faithful to the sequential and partial nature of healthcare data.",2020,,,,,,,,,#69,Killian 2020,"",""
Inverse Reinforcement Learning in Contextual MDPs,"Belogolovsky, Stav; Korsunsky, Philip; Mannor, Shie; Tessler, Chen; Zahavy, Tom","We consider the task of Inverse Reinforcement Learning in Contextual Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In this setting, contexts, which define the reward and transition kernel, are sampled from a distribution. In addition, although the reward is a function of the context, it is not provided to the agent. Instead, the agent observes demonstrations from an optimal policy. The goal is to learn the reward mapping, such that the agent will act optimally even when encountering previously unseen contexts, also known as zero-shot transfer. We formulate this problem as a non-differential convex optimization problem and propose a novel algorithm to compute its subgradients. Based on this scheme, we analyze several methods both theoretically, where we compare the sample complexity and scalability, and empirically. Most importantly, we show both theoretically and empirically that our algorithms perform zero-shot transfer (generalize to new and unseen contexts). Specifically, we present empirical experiments in a dynamic treatment regime, where the goal is to learn a reward function which explains the behavior of expert physicians based on recorded data of them treating patients diagnosed with sepsis.",2019,,,,,,,,,#34,Belogolovsky 2019,"",""

Improving Septic Shock Prediction with AdaBoost and Cox Regression Model,"Darwiche, A.; El-Geneidy, A.; Mukherjee, S.; Ieee,","Septic shock in the advanced state of sepsis, which is a dangerous organ dysfunction disease that happens when the body responds in a dysregulated way to infectious diseases. Sepsis is hard to discover early on, and is difficult to treat if not detected sooner, hence, leading to high mortality rates.

This paper uses the MMIC-III database to create a model to effectively predict septic shock utilizing a combination of the Cox regression model and AdaBoost. The prediction model is constructed by acquiring a risk factor score using Cox regression on various septic shock indicators.

Early prediction of septic shock in hospitalized patients,"Thiel, Steven W.; Kollef, Marin H.; Rosini, Jamie M.; Micek, Scott T.; Shannon, William; Doherty, Joshua A.","BACKGROUND: Hospitalized patients who develop severe sepsis have significant morbidity and mortality. Early goal-directed therapy has been shown to decrease mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock, though a delay in recognizing impending sepsis often precludes this intervention. OBJECTIVE(S): To identify early predictors of septic shock among hospitalized non-intensive care unit (ICU) medical patients. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: A 1200-bed academic medical center. PATIENTS: Derivation cohort consisted of 13,785 patients hospitalized during 2005. The validation cohorts consisted of 13,737 patients during 2006 and 13,937 patients from 2007. INTERVENTION: Development and prospective validation of a prediction model using Recursive Partitioning And Regression Tree (RPART) analysis.

Transatlantic transferability of a new reinforcement learning model for optimizing haemodynamic treatment for critically ill patients with sepsis,"Ahrendt, Jonas; Guo, Tingjie; Thoral, Patrick; Girbes, Armand R. J.; Elbers, Paul W. G.; Roggeveen, Luca; el Hassouni, Ali; Fleuren, Lucas; Hoogendoorn, Mark","Introduction: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has gained traction in the healthcare domain. In particular, RL methods have been explored for haemodynamic optimization of septic patients in the Intensive Care Unit. Most hospitals however, lack the data and expertise for model development, necessitating transfer of models developed using external datasets. This approach assumes model generalizability across different patient populations, the validity of which has not previously been tested. In addition, there is limited knowledge on safety and reliability. These challenges need to be addressed to further facilitate implementation of RL models in clinical practice. Method(s): We developed and validated a new reinforcement learning model for hemodynamic optimization in sepsis on the MIMIC intensive care database from the USA using a dueling double deep Q network. We then transferred this model to the European AmsterdamUMCdb intensive care database. T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were used to explore the differences between the patient populations. We apply off-policy policy evaluation methods to quantify model performance. In addition, we introduce and apply a novel deep policy inspection to analyse how the optimal policy relates to the different phases of sepsis and sepsis treatment to provide interpretable insight in order to assess model safety and reliability. Result(s): The off-policy evaluation revealed that the optimal policy outperformed the physician policy on both datasets despite marked differences between the two patient populations and physician's policies. Our novel deep policy inspection method showed insightful results and unveiled that the model could initiate therapy adequately and adjust therapy intensity to illness severity and disease progression which indicated safe and reliable model behaviour. Compared to current physician behavior, the developed policy prefers a more liberal use of vasopressors with a more restrained use of fluid therapy in line with previous work. Conclusion(s): We created a reinforcement learning model for optimal bedside hemodynamic management and demonstrated model transferability between populations from the USA and Europe for the first time. We proposed new methods for deep policy inspection integrating expert domain knowledge. This is expected to facilitate progression to bedside clinical decision support for the treatment of critically ill patients.Copyright © 2020",2021,,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,112,,102003,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2020.102003,,#3693,Ahrendt 2021,Finneas Catling (2022-03-05 04:44:32)(Included): Good idea - I'll add them to covidence and see if there are any non-duplicates; Zuzanna Bien (2022-02-04 22:14:27)(Select): they include a table of papers on reinforcement learning in sepsis -might be worth cross checking if we caught all the papers involved ; ,""
Predicting Progression to Septic Shock in the Emergency Department Using an Externally Generalizable Machine-Learning Algorithm,"Carlile, Morgan; Hayden, Stephen R.; Wardi, Gabriel; Shashikumar, Supreeth; Nemati, Shamim; Holder, Andre","Study objective: Machine-learning algorithms allow improved prediction of sepsis syndromes in the emergency department (ED), using data from electronic medical records. Transfer learning, a new subfield of machine learning, allows generalizability of an algorithm across clinical sites. We aim to validate the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert for the prediction of delayed septic shock in a cohort of patients treated in the ED and demonstrate the feasibility of transfer learning to improve external validity at a second site. Method(s): This was an observational cohort study using data from greater than 180,000 patients from 2 academic medical centers between 2014 and 2019, using multiple definitions of sepsis. The Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm was trained with 40 input variables at the development site to predict delayed septic shock (occurring greater than 4 hours after ED triage) at various prediction windows. We then validated the algorithm at a second site, using transfer learning to demonstrate generalizability of the algorithm. Result(s): We identified 9,354 patients with severe sepsis, of whom 723 developed septic shock at least 4 hours after triage. The Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm demonstrated excellent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (>0.8) at 8 and 12 hours for the prediction of delayed septic shock. Transfer learning significantly improved the test characteristics of the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm and yielded comparable performance at the validation site.

Septic shock prediction for ICU patients via coupled HMM walking on sequential contrast patterns,"Ghosh, Shameek; Li, Jinyan; Cao, Longbing; Ramamohanarao, Kotagiri","Background and objective Critical care patient events like sepsis or septic shock in intensive care units (ICUs) are dangerous complications which can cause multiple organ failures and eventual death. Preventive prediction of such events will allow clinicians to stage effective interventions for averting these critical complications. Methods It is widely understood that physiological conditions of patients on variables such as blood pressure and heart rate are suggestive to gradual changes over a certain period of time, prior to the occurrence of a septic shock. This work investigates the performance of a novel machine learning approach for the early prediction of septic shock. The approach combines highly informative sequential patterns extracted from multiple physiological variables and captures the interactions among these patterns via coupled hidden Markov models (CHMM). In particular, the patterns are extracted from three non-invasive waveform measurements: the mean arterial pressure levels, the heart rates and respiratory rates of septic shock patients from a large clinical ICU dataset called MIMIC-II. Evaluation and results For baseline estimations, SVM and HMM models on the continuous time series data for the given patients, using MAP (mean arterial pressure), HR (heart rate), and RR (respiratory rate) are employed. Single channel patterns based HMM (SCP-HMM) and multi-channel patterns based coupled HMM (MCP-HMM) are compared against baseline models using 5-fold cross validation accuracies over multiple rounds. Particularly, the results of MCP-HMM are statistically significant having a p-value of 0.0014, in comparison to baseline models. Our experiments demonstrate a strong competitive accuracy in the prediction of septic shock, especially when the interactions between the multiple variables are coupled by the learning model. Conclusions It can be concluded that the novelty of the approach, stems from the integration of sequence-based physiological pattern markers with the sequential CHMM model to learn dynamic physiological behavior, as well as from the coupling of such patterns to build powerful risk stratification models for septic shock patients.Copyright © 2016",2017,,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,66,,19-31,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2016.12.010,,#2499,Ghosh 2017,"",""

This study aimed to identify subclasses of sepsis and its responses to different amounts of fluid resuscitation. Method(s): This was a retrospective study conducted in an intensive care unit at a large tertiary care hospital. The patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of sepsis from June 1, 2001 to October 31, 2012 were included. Clinical and laboratory variables were used to perform the latent profile analysis (LPA). A multivariable logistic regression model was used to explore the independent association of fluid input and mortality outcome. Result(s): In total, 14,993 patients were included in the study. The LPA identified four subclasses of sepsis: profile 1 was characterized by the lowest mortality rate and having the largest proportion and was considered the baseline type; profile 2 was characterized by respiratory dysfunction; profile 3 was characterized by multiple organ dysfunction (kidney, coagulation, liver, and shock), and profile 4 was characterized by neurological dysfunction. Profile 3 showed the highest mortality rate (45.4%), followed by profile 4 (27.4%), 2 (18.2%), and 1 (16.9%). Overall, the amount of fluid needed for resuscitation was the largest on day 1 (median 5115 mL, interquartile range (IQR) 2662 to 8800 mL) and decreased rapidly on day 2 (median 2140 mL, IQR 900 to 3872 mL).

Time-Aware Q-Networks: Resolving Temporal Irregularity for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Kim, Yeo Jin; Chi, Min","Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown outstanding performance on inducing effective action policies that maximize expected long-term return on many complex tasks. Much of DRL work has been focused on sequences of events with discrete time steps and ignores the irregular time intervals between consecutive events. Given that in many real-world domains, data often consists of temporal sequences with irregular time intervals, and it is important to consider the time intervals between temporal events to capture latent progressive patterns of states. In this work, we present a general Time-Aware RL framework: Time-aware Q-Networks (TQN), which takes into account physical time intervals within a deep RL framework. TQN deals with time irregularity from two aspects: 1) elapsed time in the past and an expected next observation time for time-aware state approximation, and 2) action time window for the future for time-aware discounting of rewards. Experimental results show that by capturing the underlying structures in the sequences with time irregularities from both aspects, TQNs significantly outperform DQN in four types of contexts with irregular time intervals. More specifically, our results show that in classic RL tasks such as CartPole and MountainCar and Atari benchmark with randomly segmented time intervals, time-aware discounting alone is more important while in the real-world tasks such as nuclear reactor operation and septic patient treatment with intrinsic time intervals, both time-aware state and time-aware discounting are crucial. Moreover, to improve the agent's learning capacity, we explored three boosting methods: Double networks, Dueling networks, and Prioritized Experience Replay, and our results show that for the two real-world tasks, combining all three boosting methods with TQN is especially effective.",2021,,,,,,,,,#89,Kim 2021,"",""

The AIoT-based model represented better performance than CURB-65 and PSI indicators for predicting mortality (0.835 vs. 0.681 and 0.835 vs. 0.728). Conclusions: A real-time interactive AIoT-based model might be a better tool for predicting adverse outcomes in ED patients with pneumonia.

Early detection of septic shock onset using interpretable machine learners,"Misra, Debdipto; Sandhu, Ranjeet; Karunakaran, Bipin; Avula, Venkatesh; Li, Jiang; Abedi, Vida; Wolk, Donna M.; Farag, Hosam A.; Mehta, Yatin B.; Kethireddy, Shravan; Zand, Ramin","Background: Developing a decision support system based on advances in machine learning is one area for strategic innovation in healthcare. Predicting a patient's progression to septic shock is an active field of translational research. The goal of this study was to develop a working model of a clinical decision support system for predicting septic shock in an acute care setting for up to 6 h from the time of admission in an integrated healthcare setting. Method(s): Clinical data from Electronic Health Record (EHR), at encounter level, were used to build a predictive model for progression from sepsis to septic shock up to 6 h from the time of admission; that is, T = 1, 3, and 6 h from admission. Eight different machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, C5.0, Decision Trees, Boosted Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Regularized Logistic, and Bayes Generalized Linear Model) were used for model development. Two adaptive sampling strategies were used to address the class imbalance. Data from two sources (clinical and billing codes) were used to define the case definition (septic shock) using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Sepsis criteria. The model assessment was performed using Area under Receiving Operator Characteristics (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity. Model predictions for each feature window (1, 3 and 6 h from admission) were consolidated. Result(s): Retrospective data from April 2005 to September 2018 were extracted from the EHR, Insurance Claims, Billing, and Laboratory Systems to create a dataset for septic shock detection. The clinical criteria and billing information were used to label patients into two classes-septic shock patients and sepsis patients at three different time points from admission, creating two different case-control cohorts. Data from 45,425 unique in-patient visits were used to build 96 prediction models comparing clinical-based definition versus billing-based information as the gold standard. Of the 24 consolidated models (based on eight machine learning algorithms and three feature windows), four models reached an AUROC greater than 0.9. Overall, all the consolidated models reached an AUROC of at least 0.8820 or higher. Based on the AUROC of 0.9483, the best model was based on Random Forest, with a sensitivity of 83.9% and specificity of 88.1%. The sepsis detection window at 6 h outperformed the 1 and 3-h windows. The sepsis definition based on clinical variables had improved performance when compared to the sepsis definition based on only billing information. Conclusion(s): This study corroborated that machine learning models can be developed to predict septic shock using clinical and administrative data. However, the use of clinical information to define septic shock outperformed models developed based on only administrative data. Intelligent decision support tools can be developed and integrated into the EHR and improve clinical outcomes and facilitate the optimization of resources in real-time.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Is Deep Reinforcement Learning Ready for Practical Applications in Healthcare? A Sensitivity Analysis of Duel-DDQN for Hemodynamic Management in Sepsis Patients,"Lu, MingYu; Shahn, Zachary; Sow, Daby; Doshi-Velez, Finale; Lehman, Li-wei H.","The potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been demonstrated through successful applications to games such as Go and Atari. However, while it is straightforward to evaluate the performance of an RL algorithm in a game setting by simply using it to play the game, evaluation is a major challenge in clinical settings where it could be unsafe to follow RL policies in practice. Thus, understanding sensitivity of RL policies to the host of decisions made during implementation is an important step toward building the type of trust in RL required for eventual clinical uptake. In this work, we perform a sensitivity analysis on a state-of-the-art RL algorithm (Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks)applied to hemodynamic stabilization treatment strategies for septic patients in the ICU. We consider sensitivity of learned policies to input features, embedding model architecture, time discretization, reward function, and random seeds. We find that varying these settings can significantly impact learned policies, which suggests a need for caution when interpreting RL agent output.",2020,,,,,,,,,#72,Lu 2020,"",""

DeepRite: Deep Recurrent Inverse TreatmEnt Weighting for Adjusting Time-varying Confounding in Modern Longitudinal Observational Data,"Xu, Yanbo; Xiao, Cao; Sun, Jimeng","Counterfactual prediction is about predicting outcome of the unobserved situation from the data. For example, given patient is on drug A, what would be the outcome if she switch to drug B. Most of existing works focus on modeling counterfactual outcome based on static data. However, many applications have time-varying confounding effects such as multiple treatments over time. How to model such time-varying effects from longitudinal observational data? How to model complex high-dimensional dependency in the data? To address these challenges, we propose Deep Recurrent Inverse TreatmEnt weighting (DeepRite) by incorporating recurrent neural networks into two-phase adjustments for the existence of time-varying confounding in modern longitudinal data. In phase I cohort reweighting we fit one network for emitting time dependent inverse probabilities of treatment, use them to generate a pseudo balanced cohort. In phase II outcome progression, we input the adjusted data to the subsequent predictive network for making counterfactual predictions. We evaluate DeepRite on both synthetic data and a real data collected from sepsis patients in the intensive care units.

A Data-Driven Approach to Predicting Septic Shock in the Intensive Care Unit,"Yee, Christopher R.; Narain, Niven R.; Akmaev, Viatcheslav R.; Vemulapalli, Vijetha","Early diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock has been unambiguously linked to lower mortality and better patient outcomes. Despite this, there is a strong unmet need for a reliable clinical tool that can be used for large-scale automated screening to identify high-risk patients. We addressed the following questions: Can a novel algorithm to identify patients at high risk of septic shock 24 hours before diagnosis be discovered using available clinical data? What are performance characteristics of this predictive algorithm? Can current metrics for evaluation of sepsis be improved using novel algorithm? Publicly available data from the intensive care unit setting was used to build septic shock and control patient cohorts. Using Bayesian networks, causal relationships between diagnosis groups, procedure groups, laboratory results, and demographic data were inferred. Predictive model for septic shock 24 hours prior to digital diagnosis was built based on inferred causal networks. Sepsis risk scores were augmented by de novo inferred model and performance was evaluated. A novel predictive model to identify high-risk patients 24 hours ahead of time, with area under curve of 0.81, negative predictive value of 0.87, and a positive predictive value as high as 0.65 was built. The specificity of quick sequential organ failure assessment, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and modified early warning score was improved when augmented with the novel model, whereas no improvements were made to the sequential organ failure assessment score. We used a data-driven, expert knowledge agnostic method to build a screening algorithm for early detection of septic shock. The model demonstrates strong performance in the data set used and provides a basis for expanding this work toward building an algorithm that is used to screen patients based on electronic medical record data in real time.

We adopt a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) framework in a continuous action space with a clinically significant reward function, and use a Switching Generalized Linear Model (SGLM) to characterize patient-specific clinical states.

The RL agent receives short- and long-term rewards associated with optimizing in-hospital survival and avoiding end-organ damage to learn volume resuscitation and vasopressor dosing strategies. On average, the RL agent learns to resuscitate patients earlier than clinicians with a fluid bolus (one hour vs. four hours after the diagnosis of sepsis), and improves the expected survival by approx 3%.

We applied fuzzy logic principles to modify intravenous norepinephrine (noradrenaline) infusion rates during norepinephrine infusion in septic patients in order to reduce the duration of shock. Method(s): Septic patients were randomly assigned to norepinephrine infused either at the clinician's discretion (control group) or under closed-loop control based on fuzzy logic (fuzzy group). The infusion rate changed automatically after analysis of mean arterial pressure in the fuzzy group. The primary end-point was time to cessation of norepinephrine. The secondary end-points were 28-day survival, total amount of norepinephine infused and duration of mechanical ventilation. Result(s): Nineteen patients were randomly assigned to fuzzy group and 20to control group. Weaning of norepinephrine was achieved in 18 of the 20 control patients and in all 19 fuzzy group patients. Median (interquartile range) duration of shock was significantly shorter in the fuzzy group than in the control group (28.5 [20.5 to 42] hours versus 57.5 [43.7 to 117.5] hours; P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in duration of mechanical ventilation or survival at 28 days between the two groups.
